The chase is on. Agent 005 makes away with an attache case. A hovering helicopter awaits his arrival, but first... Enemy guards pound the street in pursuit. 005 must duck into a new scene.

Inside a warehouse. Avoid being caught in the guard's flashlight beams... once 005 is detected, the chase quickens to super fast. Blast the guards with stun-gas and score valuable points.

Slip into a skate rink. And slip you will. There is no stopping on ice and the same goes for the thrills. Sliding and firing... firing and sliding. 005 can call his helicopter to escape.

The final flight fight. High flying aerial excitement. 005 has reached his helicopter in all other scenes and now finds his high scoring, high soaring getaway copter in a new test balloon and parachute bombs close in from all sides. 005 blast away to score points and to escape. Then the final challenge is thrown at his skill - a blazing battle with the enemy copter. Win now and you win big.

It's free-wheeling fun with fun-filled music and sound. Its stealth and pursuit is like no other video game. Everybody's after Agent 005. You should be, too. Call your nearest Sega/Gremlin distributor today and make sure 005 is on your side."

";"""1942"" is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in the Pacific theatre during World War II, in which the goal is to reach Tokyo and destroy the entire Japanese air fleet. 

The player pilots a plane dubbed the ""Super Ace"" (its appearance is that of a Lockheed P-38 Lightning) and has to shoot down waves of enemy planes while avoiding incoming enemy fire. The 'Super Ace' can perform a limited number of rolls or 'loop-the-loops' to evade enemy planes and shots. 

During the game, waves of red enemy planes periodically appear. If the player manages to destroy a red wave, a power-up, in the form of a 'POW' symbol, will be dropped and can be picked up. The power-up will award either increased fire-power (doubling the player's guns from two to four), a smart bomb that destroys all on-screen enemy planes the instant it's collected, two wingmen planes that flank the Super Ace and increase fire power, or simply extra points.

At the end of each stage the 'Super Ace' lands on an aircraft carrier and bonus points are awarded based on player performance. ""1942"" differs from other games in that its levels are numbered in reverse order, so the game begins at stage 32 and ends at stage 1."

";"Sankokushi is an adult Shanghai solitaire game. Unlike in a standard mahjong solitaire game, tiles are removed in groups of three.  These groups may be made up of three matching tiles, or the number sets, 1-3, 4-6, or 7-9. The objective is to find the four, three-tile sets shown at the start of the stage and remove them from the game board before the timer runs out.

When a tile is selected, other tiles are lit up.  Tiles within the number sequence are shown in pink, and matching tiles are shown in orange.  The player may request hints by selecting the help button on screen, which will light up all tiles that can be removed from the board at that time.  There is also a back button, which the player may select to return tiles to the screen.

The background image in each stage is an image of a girl.  Each girl has two background images, with the second image showing the girl topless. Once a player removes the four tile sets for the stage, the board is cleared and the player may see the entire image.

After completing a stage the player may use the points he has earned to buy power-ups, such as extra hints or a faster cursor.

The game is over once the timer has run out or if the player cannot legally remove any more tiles and the board is 'deadlocked'.  Upon continuing the player may select to play the same board or play a different one."

";"600 is a maze game where the player is a turtle trying to bring baby turtles, called 'kidturtles' to their homes while avoiding beetles. Scattered throughout the maze are boxes with question marks on them. When the player walks over a question mark, a baby turtle will crawl onto the main turtle's back, a house will appear at a random location on the map, and the player will have to bring the baby turtle to its house while avoiding beetles. 

Other times, beetles will come out of the boxes, which the player will have to quickly run away from. The player's only offensive move is the ability to drop ""smart bombs"" to temporarily stun the beetles. The player's smart bombs can be refilled by grabbing the smart bombs in the middle of the maze. However, unlike actual smart bombs, the player's bombs do not move and stay in a single place until a beetle runs over it. 

You have eight floors to deal with the beetles, then you'll go to the roof to get your baby turtles, after you go get them, you walk home with the rest of the baby turtles you collected. The game pattern is endless."

";"720° is a one or two-player arcade game with players taking on the role of a skateboarder, and must perform various tricks and maneuvers to earn the points and tickets needed to compete for medals in the game's numerous skate parks. 

The bulk of the action takes place in a 'Skate City', a small urban area made up of ramps, jumps and hazards. Players can skate anywhere they wish as they perform the tricks and jumps needed to reach the score thresholds that will earn them entry tickets to Skate City's skate parks to compete for medals and cash prizes. 

Each score threshold must be reached and a park entered within a tight time limit. Failure to do so sees the skater persued by a swarm of bees and the words SKATE OR DIE appear. Should the bees touch the skater before he enters a park, the game ends. Skate City's roads and pavements are populated with moving traffic and pedestrians and any collision with them will result in the skater being knocked from his board, costing the player precious seconds. 

The parks themselves each feature one of four different disciplines: Slalom, Jump, Downhill and Ramp. Each park has a timer and players can earn either a bronze, silver or gold medal - together with a cash prize - depending on how quickly the park is completed. If the park target score or finish line is not reached before the timer expires, no medal or money is awarded. 

Money won can be used to buy equipment upgrades from the stalls that litter Skate City. Players can buy upgraded boards, helmets, pads and shoes. Boards give faster speed; helmets allow for more risky maneuvers; pads give a faster recovery from falls and shoes provide more height on jumps, as well as giving a quicker standing start. 

At the start of each new game, players can select from one of two play modes. 'Training Level' is available for beginners and gives players numerous playing hints and tips. 'Experienced Level' is more challenging as well as offering fewer hints. It does, however, include the 'add-a-coin' feature, which allows for awards and items already won to be carried over to a new game. 

The main objective is to compete in as many skate parks as possible. There are numerous city hazards to be avoided, such as BMX riders, cars, Frisbee throwers and other skaters. To guide the player around Skate City are map tiles. Riding over one of these will temporaily pause the action and display the layout of the city, including the locations of the skate parks and equipment stalls. 

720° features ten 'class levels' which determine the degree of difficulty in the skate parks and the timer in the city streets. Each of the four skate parks is graded in difficulty, ranging from 1 (easiest) to 4 (hardest). 

By using the add-a-coin option available in the 'Advanced' game mode, players can keep any special skate equipment they have acquired in the previous game, as well as all accumulated cash, tickets, points and medals.

";"720° is a one or two-player arcade game with players taking on the role of a skateboarder, and must perform various tricks and maneuvers to earn the points and tickets needed to compete for medals in the game's numerous skate parks. 

The bulk of the action takes place in a 'Skate City', a small urban area made up of ramps, jumps and hazards. Players can skate anywhere they wish as they perform the tricks and jumps needed to reach the score thresholds that will earn them entry tickets to Skate City's skate parks to compete for medals and cash prizes. 

Each score threshold must be reached and a park entered within a tight time limit. Failure to do so sees the skater persued by a swarm of bees and the words SKATE OR DIE appear. Should the bees touch the skater before he enters a park, the game ends. Skate City's roads and pavements are populated with moving traffic and pedestrians and any collision with them will result in the skater being knocked from his board, costing the player precious seconds. 

The parks themselves each feature one of four different disciplines: Slalom, Jump, Downhill and Ramp. Each park has a timer and players can earn either a bronze, silver or gold medal - together with a cash prize - depending on how quickly the park is completed. If the park target score or finish line is not reached before the timer expires, no medal or money is awarded. 

Money won can be used to buy equipment upgrades from the stalls that litter Skate City. Players can buy upgraded boards, helmets, pads and shoes. Boards give faster speed; helmets allow for more risky maneuvers; pads give a faster recovery from falls and shoes provide more height on jumps, as well as giving a quicker standing start. 

At the start of each new game, players can select from one of two play modes. 'Training Level' is available for beginners and gives players numerous playing hints and tips. 'Experienced Level' is more challenging as well as offering fewer hints. It does, however, include the 'add-a-coin' feature, which allows for awards and items already won to be carried over to a new game. 

The main objective is to compete in as many skate parks as possible. There are numerous city hazards to be avoided, such as BMX riders, cars, Frisbee throwers and other skaters. To guide the player around Skate City are map tiles. Riding over one of these will temporaily pause the action and display the layout of the city, including the locations of the skate parks and equipment stalls. 

720° features ten 'class levels' which determine the degree of difficulty in the skate parks and the timer in the city streets. Each of the four skate parks is graded in difficulty, ranging from 1 (easiest) to 4 (hardest). 

By using the add-a-coin option available in the 'Advanced' game mode, players can keep any special skate equipment they have acquired in the previous game, as well as all accumulated cash, tickets, points and medals.

";"After Burner is another Sega game rendered with their then-ubiquitous 3-D sprite-scaling technology; this time putting the player into the seat of a powerful F14 Tomcat jet fighter. 

Players must fight their way through 21 colourful, fast-moving stages, shooting down waves of enemy fighters while avoiding the enemy's incoming missiles. The F14 is equipped with a machine gun and a limited number of homing missiles. The gun has infinite ammunition and targeting is achieved by maneuvering the Tomcat so that the targeting cursor situated just in front of the jet is placed over an enemy fighter. 

To deploy missiles, the player must first 'lock-on' to the target, a sound will indicate that the lock has taken place and missiles should then be fired, these will home in on and destroy the locked-on enemy fighter. 

Missile stocks are replenished at the end of every 2nd stage, either by the appearance of a large support plane that automatically links up with the player's jet fighter, or by landing on a military airstrip - which again happens automatically. 

After Burner's straightforward shoot-em-up gameplay is simple and repetitive, but the game's incredible visuals ensured its success."

";"A great vertical scrolling shoot'em up game.

At the year 2100 A.D. Humans were exterminated by their own self-destructive nature leaving behind the consequences of environmental degradation on earth and were forced to escape to Mars leaving a bio-computer for environmental recuperation of earth to preparing the blue planet for future recolonization. But one day a half a century after humans arrived, mars was attacked by strange flying objects. To fight these enemies, the director general of the Defence Agency organized the task force army and started quickly the dogfight with invaders to neutralize the invasion. 

The operation was called 'Acrobat Mission' as it exceeded the technical limits of the pilots.

The players takes controls on one of two surviving fighters pilots, 'Jet' a male pilot and 'Nova' a female pilot and both flying the Icarus, a fast and powerful space-fighter, which comes equipped with a Standard laser. Two more weapons are available throughout the game - the wide shot (W) which spreads out in front of the ship and the Hurricane shot (H) which fires clusters of rotating balls of energy. Holding the fire button charges up a special attack and each weapon features a different energy blast and damage factor. The ships can also hold a maximum of two smart-bombs, one under each wing - although they can be activated by the players, they also do fall off easily and can be detonated by enemy shots. Interestingly, the Icarus can't collide with other ships or any part of the scenery - instead, it bounces off and only suffers damage from enemy shots. However, once the shield is depleted, the ship will fly out of control for a few seconds and grant the players a last chance to inflict damage to any remaining enemies before it explodes."

All of the vehicles are, of course, fully armed to deal with the many enemy vehicles and gun emplacements intent on stopping the player's progress.

There are four weapon types: L, a laser weapon, S, a support drone, M, a tracing missile, and F, gatling Fire, a spread-out vulcan bullet shot.

Four levels of power-ups are available for each weapon, however each level requires four power up tokens be collected. There are also two special ""bomb"" weapons available for collection - green Energy Spark for a screen-covering swarm of lower-power bombs and blue Thunder Drive for a narrower and more focused attack. The Energy Spark clears all bullets from the screen, while the Thunder Drive only clears bullets that actually touch the blast. This blast starts momentarily atop the player, but quickly moves forward a short distance and stays stationary for a few seconds before dissipating."

105;aliensyn;aliensyn;"Alien Syndrome (c) 1987 Sega.
";"Alien Syndrome is a overhead-view run and gun game for one or two players in which a number of Mankind's space ships and bases have been overrun by an alien race, who have taken the human inhabitants hostage.

Players control two soldiers named Ricky and Mary and must fight their way through large eight-way scrolling levels to rescue their captured comrades. Once a set number of hostages have been rescued, an exit opens and players can pass through it to fight the end-of-level guardian. Once the guardian is defeated, play moves onto the next stage.

A time-bomb is automatically set at the start of each stage, which must then be completed before the bomb's timer runs down. Failure to finish the level in time results in the death of the player characters. Weapon upgrades and maps of the current level are available at certain points and are accessed via hatchways in the wall.

";"Amidar is an abstract arcade game in which players must 'colour in' all of the rectangles on the screen. Each level has a number of patrolling enemies - or 'Amidars' - that must be avoided. Players are aided in their task with the inclusion of a JUMP button which, when used, causes all the on-screen enemies to jump; allowing the player time to escape from a close situation. There are only 3 'jumps' given per level, however.

On odd-numbered levels, the player's character is a gorilla; on even-numbered levels, it is a paint roller. The Amidar enemies are savages and pigs, respectively.

Filling the four corner boxes of the screen gives the player a short time in which to chase the Amidars and score extra points. In between levels, there is a chance to earn 5,000 bonus points. Here, a pig moves across the top of the screen. By pushing the jump button, the pig traces a path across the boxes towards the bottom of the screen. If the savage or pig reaches a bunch of bananas, a bonus is awarded."

";"(Tsuukai Gangan Koushinkyoku)

1-on-1 fighter featuring 8 selectable characters.

The game's major innovation is the ability to walk into the background, in a similar manner to side-scrolling beat 'em ups such as ""Streets of Rage"" or ""Final Fight"" because of this, unlike many other 2-D fighting games, the game uses one action button to jump, it also does not use the 'D' button, (Which many of SNK's other fighters did), only 2 action buttons are used for attacking (punch and kick), instead grappling and grabbing opponents (Pressing the A & B buttons simultaneously) is the focus of the gameplay, opponents can counter being grabbed, as well as break free. Also featured is weapon play, again similar to beat 'em ups, weapons can be picked up and thrown, or used in special & standard attacks. Weapons are thrown in by background crowd members who will step forward to toss them into the ring. Another (strange) innovation of the game is that characters start to sweat -graphically- after a while.

Characters have unusually high health for the genre, with multiple, different coloured, health bars in one bar similar to a method of health bars used for boss characters in games of the time, in addition to this, each character has a 'Crazy Meter' at the bottom of the screen, which is built up as characters attack, this gives the character a special, often very bizarre, attack that will kill the opponent outright, known as the GanGan Attack in Japan, and the Crazy Attack in the US.

Battles are joined by irreverent, sometimes humorous pre-fight banter from characters, the dialog differs depending on whom each opponent is, and a clashing of 2 small images of the characters eyes, which clash in the center of the screen."

";"You'll have 1001 hours of fun with the ARABIAN upright game! You are the adventurous Arabian prince, and your goal is to rescue the princess from her palace. Use the joystick control and the KICK button to move through perilous passages. Sail the seas, crawl in caves, and fly magic carpets - you'll be challenged by 4 increasingly hard waves of play! Score points on the way for picking up the letters in A-R-A-B-I-A-N, and get a bonus if you pick them up in order!

Arabian is a 'video book' with a happy ending! The attract mode introduces the story, and animated storybook 'pages' let you experience the Arabian Prince's adventures. Use the 8-position joystick to jump, super-jump, walk, crawl, or climb in all directions. Tap either KICK button (are you right- or left-handed?) to kick your enemies out of the way.

The player controls a young Arabian Prince who must rescue his Princess from the castle tower where she is being held prisoner. Evil Genies in brass jugs, swooping Rocs, and purple ghostly creatures called Oscars will try to stop him along the way. The Prince scores points for kicking Oscars or Rocs, picking up lettered jugs, or spelling A-R-A-B-I-A-N. The Prince loses a life when he's hit by a smokeball, falls off a ledge, flying carpet or vine, or gets caught (touched) by a Genie, Oscar, or Roc.

The Prince must successfully complete 4 levels to rescue the Princess (4 levels or 'pages' equals 1 section). Each level is introduced with the turning of a page, which shows a distant view of the upcoming playfield. Each playfield has 7 lettered jugs that must be picked up before the player can advance to the next level, but he must avoid or KICK evil Genies, Oscars, and Rocs that will try to stop him.

Page 1. Page l turns, revealing a ship. The Prince must work his way to the crow's nest at the top of the mast before the vessel reaches the shore. As he climbs up the rigging, Rocs and Oscars dive at him in an attempt to knock him down. The Prince must KICK them out of the way to survive. While contending with these rascals, he must also try to collect all the jugs with letters on them. Beware! The jugs hold devilish Genies which can appear at any time and throw smokeballs at the Prince. Once a Genie has materialized, the Prince's kicking power cannot be used against him and he is unable to collect the jug so he should avoid the Genie. However, the Prince may collect the jug while the Genie is in smoke. When the Arabian has collected all the jugs and reaches the top of the ship, Page 2 introduces the second level of the story.

Page 2. Now the Arabian has arrived on shore. To reach the Princess he must complete a cave maze under the cliff. Low-hanging rocks and climbing vines force him to crawl and climb. The Prince must still dodge Rocs, Oscars, and the Genie's smokeballs. And he must still collect the brass jugs. When he reaches the top of the cave, he must try to collect the letter N jug.

Page 3. Now the Arabian Prince must scale the walls of the castle. As flying carpets whiz by, the Arabian must jump from one to the next, taking care he isn't knocked off his present perch by another carpet flying too closely He can duck to avoid them, but his timing has to be precise or he will take a tumble down to the ground. He must still dodge Rocs, Oscars, and the Genie's smokeballs. The player must beware - sometimes a pair will merge into one super Roc bird or super Oscar!

Page 4. The Prince has at last entered the castle. The Princess beckons him from high in the tower. To reach her, he must ride atop some flying carpets and pull himself up ropes - all the while collecting the brass jugs and kicking meddlesome Rocs and Oscars. When he reaches his loving and grateful Princess, the 2 fly happily into the sunset on a magic carpet.

Once the player has taken the Arabian through a section (all 4 levels), the next section begins. But the action gets faster, the Genies are angrier and fling more smokeballs, and there are more intelligent and challenging Rocs and Oscars. Even the brass jugs are rearranged so that it becomes more difficult for the player to spell A-R-A-B-I-A-N in order."

";"Arch Rivals is a hilarious basketball game featuring customizing team names and colors. A full game consists of four quarters, with four minutes each. Each team has two players, and the objective of the game is to outscore the opponent until the final buzzer sounds. 

If the game results in a tie after four quarters, a sudden death overtime period is added, in which case the next basket to go in will win the game for the team who scored it. The overtime period is one minute long. A player can call for his teammate to pass him the ball or to shoot it. 

There are eight characters that the player can play as, each with a unique characteristic. They are : 
* Blade : A crowd pleaser. 
* Hammer : Rebound king. 
* Lewis : Top shooter.

";"While it borrows heavily from the game which established the vertically scrolling shooter, ""Xevious"", Argus adds its own unique twists. The player's ship is always presented in the center of the screen, and as the player moves left and right, the ground actually scrolls in the opposite direction. The player can continue scrolling all the way in one direction and end up back where he or she started.

Other new concepts include walls of mazes that float in the air which may be optionally traveled through. Certain ground targets provide power-ups or special weapons, but they must be bombed 3 times in order to earn them. A boss sequence occurs at the end of each stage. The boss has one infrequently exposed weak spot that only takes one bomb to destroy, but the boss will leave after an allotted time if the player does not succeed. There is a landing sequence after the boss fight that must be successfully maneuvered for bonus points. And finally, the ship receives a new weapons at each stage (5 distinct combinations which cycle).

* If you use the continue feature after Game Over, your score is not reset to zero, and you don't have to start the current level over on a continue.
* The boss battles ('Vetranoid') are played in the attract mode.
* The layouts of Rounds 3-L and 20-R have both switched places with that of Round 17 (the first 'Vetranoid' - the mini-boss), making it possible to battle the mini-boss twice or not at all.

Your controls are two 4-position joysticks with triggers. These controls make Assault like no other tank game. You have a quick, highly responsive vehicle with fast movement in all directions. To avoid enemy shots, Rapid Roll your tank left or right by moving both joysticks to the same side. To launch grenades, put the tank in the Power Wheelie position by moving both joysticks to the outside, then pressing either trigger. Your grenades are triple the fire power of your tank's standard shots.

Your tank is always in the center of the screen no matter what direction you are going. With Assault's 360-degree scrolling playfield, the world rotates around you as you move. An arrow always points you towards the exit to the next level.

The lift zone gives you an advantage over the invaders and a spectacular view of the playfield. Each lift zone is a five-sided platform on the playfield that flashes red when you can use it. When you drive onto the lift zone, your tank jets straight up to get a bird's eye view of the surrounding terrain and enemy lines. From this overhead position, you can reconnoiter enemy forces and bomb enemy outposts.

Fight your way through 11 different levels to seek out and destroy the invader’s headquarters. To succeed, you must :
* Dodge enemy gunfire with the Rapid Roll maneuver.
* Assault enemy lines with long-range powerful grenades launched from Power Wheelies.
* Destroy all enemy tanks you encounter to prevent rear attacks.
* Bomb enemy outposts and reconnoiter enemy emplacements using the lift zones.
* Protect yourself against enemy artillery using buildings and trees.
* Blow up the large cannons on each level while you avoid enemy attacks.

";"Asteroids Deluxe is a 1 or 2-player game with an X-Y or vector-generator monitor. The game depicts a third-person view of a player's spaceship battling to destroy asteroids, flying saucers and enemy ships or 'death stars' (shaped like clusters of triangles). When hit, the asteroids and death stars will break into progressively smaller pieces. 

Players can put up an octagon-shaped 'shield' to temporarily protect their spaceship. However, this shield wears out with use. 

Large asteroids appear and drift in from the outer edges of the display. By pressing the ROTATE LEFT and ROTATE RIGHT pushbuttons on the control panel, the player may aim a spaceship toward any of the asteroids. The player uses the FIRE pushbutton to shoot at the asteroids and other objects. 

When shot, each large asteroid divides into two medium-sized asteroids, and the game adds 20 points to the player's score. Medium-sized asteroids, when shot, divide into two small-sized asteroids, and the game awards 50 points to the player. When shot the smallest asteroid disappears and the game adds 100 points to the player's score. 

In addition to asteroids, the players can score points for shooting the various enemy ships. When hit, the large ships ('death stars' shaped like hexagons) score 50 points and break into three diamond shapes. The medium-sized enemy or diamond, when hit, grants the player 100 points and breaks into two small triangular pieces. These small pieces disappear when the player hits them, and the score increases by 200 points. 

At any time during game play, a flying saucer may appear from either side of the display. The game awards players 200 points for shooting a large saucer and 1,000 points for a small saucer (the latter is a smaller target for players, though not any faster moving than the large one. It also shoots more accurately). 

The player's objective in the game is to shoot and destroy as many asteroids, saucers, and enemy ships as possible before all his or her spaceships are destroyed. A ship is destroyed if an asteroid, saucer or enemy ship smashes into it, or if a flying saucer shoots it. To prevent losing a ship, the player may press the THRUST pushbutton to move out of the path of an oncoming object. 

As an emergency maneuver, a player can press the Shields button. An octagon will then appear around the player's ship as protection from all enemies. For challenge the shield power lasts only about 10 seconds, but the power is renewed with each ship. The amount of shielding power available is shown by the brightness of the octagon (dim means almost exhausted power).

Large Asteroid - These are the large rocks that fill the screen at the beginning of each stage. Hitting one with a bullet will break it apart in to two Medium Asteroids. 

Medium Asteroid - Slightly smaller than Large Asteroids, but faster moving, shooting one of these will result in two Small Asteroids. 

Small Asteroid - These are the smallest and fastest rocks on the screen. If a bullet hits one of these, it will vaporize.

Triangle - When a Diamond is shot it breaks up in to two separate triangles. These will move very quickly and zero in on you if you don't destroy them fast enough. 

Large Saucer - Large flying saucers appear on the screen from time to time, randomly firing shots around the screen. Approximately one out of every four shots will be aimed directly at your ship. They will also target Hexagons if any are on the screen at the same time. 

Small Saucer - The small saucers are deadlier than the large variety. They are much more precise with their shots, and are more likely to kill you. Eliminate them quickly or get out of their range."

";"The object of the game is to destroy as many asteroid boulders as possible and keep your ship in space as long as possible. Use your Joystick Controller to maneuver your ship through space and press the red controller(fire) button to shoot photon torpedoes at the asteroid boulders. When an asteroid is hit, it may just break up into smaller boulders, or it may be completely pulverized. In some game variations you'll face additional space hazards such as satellites and UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects); both of which may be firing torpedoes at you.

Asteroids includes 66 game variations for 1 or 2 players."
210;asteroib;asteroidb;"Asteroids (c) 1979 Atari, Incorporated.
";"Asteroids is a legendary, genre defining game - in an era replete with genre-defining classics - in which a single player takes control of a spaceship trapped in the middle of an asteroid belt. A number of large, slow-moving asteroids drift randomly around the play area and must be shot by the player. When shot, the asteroids will break into a number of smaller pieces which must also be shot until eventually, all of the asteroids and fragments will be destroyed and the next wave begins. 

Asteroids introduced real-world physics to video games for the first time, with speed and inertia all adding to the player's problems. As well as the inertia of the player's ship - forcing the player to allow for the ship slowing down and speeding up whenever the Thrust button was utilized - shot asteroids would often send fragments flying in seemingly random directions, and at varying and unpredictable speeds. 

As well as the ever-present asteroids, flying saucers also make a regular appearance. These move horizontally and diagonally around the screen, firing at the player's ship, and must be quickly destroyed. They are destroyed when hit by the player's shot, when hit by a saucer's shot or when they collide with an asteroid. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

Spaceship - This is you, the player. You can rotate 360 degrees, fire bullets, thrust forward in any direction, and hyperspace to safety if you feel you are in danger. 

Large Asteroid - These are the large rocks that fill the screen at the beginning of each stage. Hitting one with a bullet will break it apart into two Medium Asteroids. 

Medium Asteroid - Slightly smaller than Large Asteroids, but faster moving. Shooting one of these will result in two Small Asteroids. 

Small Asteroid - These are the smallest and fastest rocks on the screen. If a bullet hits one of these, it will vaporize. 

Large Saucer - Large flying saucers appear on the screen from time to time, randomly firing shots around the screen. They pose a minor threat. 

Small Saucer - The smaller flying saucers are deadlier than the large variety. They are much more precise with their shots, and are more likely to kill you. Eliminate them quickly or get out of their range."

217;astrob;astrob;"Astro Blaster (c) 1981 Sega.
";"Astro Blaster is a 1- or 2-player game in which players must advance through squadrons of alien ships in an attempt to dock with the mother ship. Players move their ship left or right and shoot at attacking squadrons. A special time warp allows the player to slow down the alien space ships and their laser fire, while maintaining his own ship and laser fire at normal speed.

As players go through the game play, each step is directed by the voice of mission control. Mission control keeps players informed of fuel status, provides a countdown on warp, keeps track of the number of ships remaining, and monitors the player's laser temperature.

As players enter each new sector they encounter a different number of alien squadrons. Players must destroy all ships in each squadron to pass through the sector. One squadron of rockets is extremely difficult to destroy, but players can pass through this squadron by hitting a few enemy ships. Once a player has destroyed all the squadrons in that sector, he enters an asteroid belt. He must maneuver and shoot his way through the asteroids to reach the mother ship. If fuel is critically low when the player enters the asteroid belt, he can receive extra fuel by shooting the red fireballs interspersed among the asteroids. After passing through the asteroid belt, the player's ship docks with the mother ship and refuels.

There are 29 different alien squadrons players encounter as they move through the different sectors. Every new sector increases in difficulty with different numbers of squadrons in each sector. Each alien ship has its own individualized sounds, movements and firing capability.

During their game, players must keep track of fuel consumption. As the player's ship moves through the sector, it consumes fuel. The player must ensure he has enough fuel to advance through the sector and dock with the mother ship. Extra fuel can only be obtained by shooting red fireballs or docking with the mother ship. The screen also displays the laser temperature. As players fire, the laser temperature rises. When they cease firing it cools down. If the laser overheats, players lose their laser fire until it cools down.

By depressing the warp button, players slow down the enemy ships and their laser fire while maintaining his own at normal speed. Players receive one warp per ships and are awarded one warp upon docking, if he has used his warp in the previous sector.

Each alien ship destroyed carries a different point value. Players also receive double points for destroying an alien ship when their fuel is in the red. To add further excitement, there are 25 tasks that a player performs during the course of the game and receives a secret bonus. Players do not know what these tasks are, but a good player will keep track. The 25 tasks are consistent throughout the game. Players also receive a bonus for any fuel they have left when they dock with the mother ship.

With a two-player game, players alternate at the conclusion of each sector, not after each ship.  Players receive 3 to 5 ships, which is operator adjustable. The game is over when a player runs out of fuel, loses all his ships, or crashes while attempting to dock with the mother ship. The top three scores are displayed and the game ranks players from 1 to 99.

PLAY INSTRUCTIONS :
1. Shoot enemy space ships for points.
2. Shoot fire balls for extra fuel.
3. Use warp to slow down enemy ships and bombs (only once per sector or ship).
4. Discover how to earn secret bonuses for extra points.
5. Dock with mother ship to refuel after each sector.

";Avalanche is a 2-D game of skill. You control a multi-storied platform with a spinner-knob. Your goal is to prevent the falling rocks from ever reaching the ground. There are six rows of rocks to deal with. You start with a 6-storied platform and you lose one platform per row of rocks cleared. You score points for those rocks you prevent from reaching the ground. Of course, the farther the row of rocks, the smaller and faster they become. Your ultimate goal is to get enough points so that you can continue your game should you lose your first one. Get your hard hat out and prepare to catch some rogue rocks.

Bakutotsu Kijuutei is the sequel to BaRaDuKe, which was released three years earlier. As in the original game, the player must take control of a spaceman in a bio-suit (who is a caricature of a Namco employee) while fighting the strange-looking Octy and saving the one-eyed Paccets - except this time Player 1 is Takky and Player 2 is Hommy. The Paccets that the spacemen collect during the stage now come in two different colours (yellow and white), and will circle around them, and the yellow ones will also add to their scores at the end of the stage (for 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 7650 points in succession) instead of featuring in the bonus game, which now only happens before a boss stage; however, the white ones will not, because they cannot be killed. If a yellow Paccet is accidentally shot or killed by an enemy, he will explode and send his eyeball flying - and if the player catches the eyeball he will receive a single point. Several new enemies have also been introduced (one of which, the ""Block Brain"", first appeared in Beraboh Man, and another, the ""Black Paccet"", is an evil version of the Paccets); the boss for the thirtieth stage, ""Dark Paccet"", is also an enormous evil version of the Paccets. If the player defeats Dark Paccet on his first try, the game shall not end - instead, six more stages will have to be played, and if a player wins the game (regardless of if it ends on Stage 30 or 36), he will not be able to enter his name on its high score table. There are now four different types of capsules; as a general rule, the yellow ones contain Paccets, while the red ones contain Baganns (the Pac-Man-like aliens from the original title), the blue ones contain shot powerups, and the green ones contain speed powerups. It is also now impossible to move backwards (like in Super Mario Bros.) - but if the player dies, he will be sent back to the beginning of the stage (unlike in the original, where he would restart in the place where he died) and be reprimanded by the ""Paccet Ojisan"", who also appears for the start of some stages to give him advice."

";"A reaction-based shoot-em-up in which the player takes on the role of a gun-slinging Deputy, who has been charged with protecting the town bank from outlaws. 

Each stage contains twelve numbered doors, with three doors visible on-screen at any one time. The player must scroll the screen left or right to bring other doors into view. At regular intervals, one or more doors will open to reveal either a bank customer or an outlaw. The customers must be allowed to deposit their money unharmed while the outlaws must be shot before they have a chance to shoot the deputy. Some of the outlaws must be shot twice before they are killed. If the player kills an innocent citizen, a player life is lost. 

Doors will only open when they are on-screen and a level is only completed once cash has been deposited safely into the bank via each of the twelve doors. Each level has a tight time limit, so it's important to ensure that the player reaches the doors that are about to be opened as quickly as possible. Imminent visitors are indicated by a bar graph situated above each door, with a moving red marker showing the approach of either a customer or robber. 

In addition to the outlaws, players must also be wary of time bombs that occasionally appear on one of the doors; this is indicated by both a timer and an icon above the door with the bomb. The bomb must be reached and its fuse shot before the timer runs out. As well as the outlaws and customers, a small, bow-legged cowboy occasionally appears holding gifts above his head, these can be shot for bonus points. Occasionally, an open door will reveal a town citizen bound by ropes. The player must shoot the ropes with a single shot to free the citizen. 

Bonus points are awarded for the completion of a level, with the amount determined by remaining level time and the number of moneybags deposited. Players can choose to start the game on either level one, three or six, with the harder levels earning higher bonus points for stage completion."

";"A vertically scrolling shoot'em up game. As is the standard with most arcade shooters, the player controls their ship with a joystick and two buttons. One button (Fire) shoots the main guns, and the other button (Bomb) releases a smart bomb that spreads huge energy balls all around the player's ship.

As enemies are destroyed, the player gains experience points that are separate from the score. For every 288 experience points gained, the main gun will 'level up', becoming much stronger. This is analogous to experience points and leveling up in role playing games. The weapon can only level up twice, so after it has achieved its maximum level, 288 experience points will grant the player an extra bomb.

The player can also grab P icons to increase the power of the current level gun. A maximum of five ""P""s can be collected per experience level; getting more after this gives extra points instead.

Collecting B icons increases the number of bombs, to a maximum of 7.

Apart from destroying enemies, points can be gained from collecting golden V-shaped medals. After the level is finished, 3000 points are awarded for every small one, and 5000 points for every large one. If the player's ship is destroyed during a level, all medals collected are lost."

";This game was 2-player only, you must have a live human opponent to play against, or else the other players mouse (the games promotional material said the character was a mouse), will go straight into a wall, making for a very quick and boring game. Each player moves their mouse around leaving a solid line behind them. All moves are made on an invisible grid, so you can only turn at 90 degree angles. Scattered around the gameboard are several 'fee' that you must avoid, as hitting a foot is just like smashing into a wall or a line. To win you must last longer than your opponent before hitting something (first person to hit something loses). One good strategy is to try and box your opponent in to a small section of the screen, and then just move carefully until they crash. Pushing backwards on the stick will cause you to crash into your own line, so avoid that at all cost.

";"Biomechanical Toy is a colourful eightway-scrolling platform game set in a world of magically animated toys. The magical pendulum that animates the toys has been stolen by the evil 'Scrubby' - a criminal once imprisoned for trying to steal the pendulum who has managed to escape and take his revenge.

Evil toys now patrol the kingdom and must be destroyed or avoided. Good toys have been trapped throughout the levels and if freed by Inguz, will give help by providing additional firepower for a short time.

Inguz carries a basic, single-firing gun, although additional ammo clips can be found throughout the game that upgrade the gun with either extra shot power, automatic firing or exploding bullets. When the gun's current ammo clip is empty, Inguz will take a moment to reload, leaving him vulnerable to attack.

Inguz begins each stage (and each new life) with a full health meter of eighty units, but food can be found that will boost the health meter. The player can lose a life either by running out of health, falling off the bottom of the screen, or running out of time. Clearing each stage awards bonus points based on both remaining time and health units.

Checkpoints - indicated by red flags - are located at certain points throughout the stages. In the event of losing a life, the player will restart at the last checkpoint reached. Objects with Inguz's face on them (such as wooden chests and balloons) release bonus items when shot.

An abstract, oriental-looking face occasionally forms part of a level's platform which, when shot, releases balloons which can in turn be shot for bonus items. A giant flying hat also occasionally appears and will drop bonus items when shot. Smart Bombs can also be found at certain points that, when run into by Inguz, will damage or destroy all enemy toys on screen."

The player controls a heroic young man named 'Blue' (in the two-player game the second player controls 'Princess Fa', who has identical powers to Blue), whose peaceful home planet of 'Raguy' has been invaded by the evil Daruma tribe. The Daruma are polluting the planet as they consume its dwindling resources and it falls on Blue and the Princess to stop them and save Raguy. 

Both Blue and Princess Fa have the ability to stun enemies by hitting them with a large leaf. Once stunned, they can be picked up and thrown as projectiles at other enemies. Blue and Princess Fa can also shrink in size in order to access hidden areas, but they are not able to stun enemies while shrunk. If only one player is shrunk, they can be picked up by the other player and thrown as a projectile at the enemies. 

Flowers, bonus items and power-ups are littered throughout the levels. The flowers are the game's form of currency and can be used in the shops that are located throughout the game.

- TRIVIA -

Black Tiger was released in August 1987 outside Japan. It is known in Japan as ""Black Dragon"".

Although they are similar in nature, there are also significant differences between the export version, Black Tiger, and the original version, Black Dragon. Globally, the export version is an easier game. Below are some of the more apparent differences found in these Export versions: 
* Items less expensive.
* Less pitfalls (rocks).
* Less and easiest enemies.
* Bosses easiest.
* Points given by the Red Dragon, Red Demon Warrior, and Black Dragon are differents (see scoring section).
* The bonuses are changed (different value and position).
* The secret item locations are the same but the symbols for them are different.

A bootleg of this game was released by Dragon with the same name. 

Isiah Johnson holds the official record for this game with 2344150 points on May 31, 2008.

As in many other vertical scrolling shooters (including Namco's own Xevious), the player controls a ship, facing the top of the screen, that can move freely while the background scrolls down, bringing enemies in to view; the player may destroy enemies for points. The game uses two buttons - one is used to make the ship fire circular lasers, while the other is used to cycle through its four firing patterns. The red pattern is two lasers in a spiral pattern, while the blue one is one laser straight ahead and one behind, the yellow one is one laser straight ahead, one left, and one right and the green one is two lasers diagonally forward (one to the left and one to the right), and one straight behind; by holding down the button, the ship fires more powerful, spherical lasers."

The player can then fly into the outline, and take on the form of the enemy robot, taking control of its weapons, abilities and special attacks.

There is also addition to the boss battle scoring: similar to some shooters, players have the opportunity to increase their scores by beating the end level bosses within a certain time limit. Every time a boss battle is initiated, a timer will count down and once the boss is destroyed/killed before the timer reaches zero, then the time left will add to the player's end-level score; if the timer runs out, then the score at the end of the level will remain unaffected."

Once the player has decided on the the rotation of the block, use the button to drop the block into place. The objective is to place the blocks into the pit without leaving any empty spaces. Once this is achieved, the layers without empty spaces, will disappear.

The player begins the game by selecting a starting stage. Game start level select can be chosen from stages 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20. There is a total of 100 stages in the game and as the players progress through the game, the stages get more and more difficult.
Each stage has a certain number of layers (faces) that must be erased. Once these faces are erased, the player will move on to the next stage. The less blocks the players has left in the pit at the end of the stage, the more points are awarded.

In addition to the one player mode, Block Out offers a competitive simultaneous two player mode. The split screen effect gives each player their own pit with which to play in. They compete against each other in the race to erase the faces. As one player erases a face, that face will be added to the opponent's pit, making their pit rise. This allows less room to work.

The player takes on the role of a barbarian hero who must jump and fight his way through a variety of colourful, enemy-packed levels, collecting treasure and weapon power-ups and rescuing the trapped 'wise old men' that litter the levels. 

Rescuing the wise men sees the player awarded 'Zeny coins'; these are the game's currency and allow the player to buy such items as weapon and armour upgrades, keys for treasure chests, anti-poisoning potions and health potions from the shops that appear on each level. Occasionally, a rescued wise man will also offer to sell the player weapon and armour power-ups. 

The barbarian hero is armed with a spiked mace on the end of a long chain, as well as unlimited throwing daggers. Both these and the armour worn by the barbarian (which offers limited protection from enemy attacks) can be upgraded by finding or buying the relevant power-ups.

The sprawling, eight-way scrolling levels are packed with hidden bonuses to encourage and reward exploration. These bonuses are in the form of weapon and armour power-ups, as well as valuable treasure items. Many levels also include a hidden dungeon and each dungeon is filled with both bonus items and trapped wise men.

Special items that reveal coins, upgraded armour, or simply bonus points can be found by attacking certain walls."

- TRIVIA -

Black Tiger was released in August 1987 outside Japan. It is known in Japan as ""Black Dragon"".

Although they are similar in nature, there are also significant differences between the export version, Black Tiger, and the original version, Black Dragon. Globally, the export version is an easier game. Below are some of the more apparent differences found in these Export versions: 
* Items less expensive.
* Less pitfalls (rocks).
* Less and easiest enemies.
* Bosses easiest.
* Points given by the Red Dragon, Red Demon Warrior, and Black Dragon are differents (see scoring section).
* The bonuses are changed (different value and position).
* The secret item locations are the same but the symbols for them are different.

A bootleg of this game was released by Dragon with the same name. 

Isiah Johnson holds the official record for this game with 2344150 points on May 31, 2008.

- SCORING -

Scoring is exactly the same as in the original Japanese version except for the following bosses : 
Dragon (red): 10,000 points 
Demon Warrior (red): 150,000 points 
Dragon (black): 10,000 points."

Each player moves their character around leaving a solid line behind them. All moves are made on an invisible grid, so you can only turn at 90 degree angles. To win you must last longer than your opponent before hitting something (first person to hit something loses).

417;blockout;blockout;"Block Out (c) 1989 Technos Japan Corp.
";"Block Out is a 1-player or a simultaneous 2 players competitive game of unique dimensional action and strategy.
As the blocks drop one-by-one into the three-dimensional pit, rotate them by using the three buttons and joystick. Once the player has decided on the the rotation of the block, use the button to drop the block into place. The objective is to place the blocks into the pit without leaving any empty spaces. Once this is achieved, the layers without empty spaces, will disappear.

The player begins the game by selecting a starting stage. Game start level select can be chosen from stages 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20. There is a total of 100 stages in the game and as the players progress through the game, the stages get more and more difficult.
Each stage has a certain number of layers (faces) that must be erased. Once these faces are erased, the player will move on to the next stage. The less blocks the players has left in the pit at the end of the stage, the more points are awarded.

In addition to the one player mode, Block Out offers a competitive simultaneous two player mode. The split screen effect gives each player their own pit with which to play in. They compete against each other in the race to erase the faces. As one player erases a face, that face will be added to the opponent's pit, making their pit rise. This allows less room to work. There are two ways to win in the 2-player mode :
1) Force the opponent to the top of their pit and out of the game
or
2) Erase 21 faces first."

419;bloods11;bloodstm11;"Blood Storm (c) 1994 Strata.
";"Blood Storm is considered by many as a quasi-'sequel' to Time Killers. The game had a rather dark storyline as there were few ambiguously good characters as the other ranged from being sociopathically insane or deceptive folk.

BloodStorm was dubbed as a possible “MK-killer” in an attempt to surpass rival Midway's success with Mortal Kombat, though it did not prevail. It was the last game Strata produced before the company went out of business.

As with its predecessor Time Killers, BloodStorm features many of the aspects carried down from it, such as the removal of an opponent’s arms and an ‘instant kill’ attack, as well as a Special Death Move. The button layout is virtually the same. They are labeled as ""back leg"", ""front leg"", ""back arm"" and ""front arm"" respectively. A button in the center is used to make the character block. As one would suspect, if a particular limb is lost in combat, its corresponding button is rendered useless.

BloodStorm is also a weapons-based fighter, though it differs from Time Killers in that the characters use weapons called ""Gauntlets"" that also allow them to use particular powers and attacks with them. Other than being able to bash off an opponent’s arms, a technique called a ‘Sunder’ is also in the game. If executed when an opponent is stunned, it will destroy their lower body. The character will not be able to jump or use kicks, but can still move back and forth a little with the leg buttons.

Even after a successful Sunder attack, the fight can still go on, if the character’s life bar is not totally drained yet. However, if both limbs are lost afterwards (if they weren't already torn off prior to the Sunder attack) then s/he is almost completely helpless. (There are a few special moves that don't require arms or legs, and those can still be performed). Characters are restored back to normal form after a round is over much like Time Killers as well.

A notable feature in the game is that when an opponent is defeated, the player gains a ‘passable power’ much like in a style akin to the Mega Man series. These powers or weapons can be used at any time to give the player a further advantage. Also, players can save their progress in a game with a password feature by pressing buttons during the player select screen. However, since the data was saved only until the machine was turned off, it was less than beneficial unless used to pick the game back up where it ended."

";"Blasteroids is a 1 or 2-player update of Atari's seminal ""Asteroids"", where the object of the game is to clear all sectors of the asteroids and enemy ships. Once this task is completed, the player goes on to battle Mukor - the ""boss"" asteroid who rules all galaxies - and destroy him.

The player's ship appears first in the center of four vortices, he or she must chose which vortex they wish to enter, which then transports them to a sector of their chosen star system.

Unlike in ""Asteroids"", the player ship has a finite amount of fuel which must be replenished as often as possible. This is achieved by destroying specifically-colored asteroids which turn into collectible crystals. Not all sectors contain the crystal-bearing asteroids, however, and if the player runs out of fuel, a ship is lost. The game contains three different ship configurations and the player can switch between them at any time during a level. The three configurations are : Speeder (small and fast, but weak), Fighter (medium speed and strength) and Warrior (large and strong but very slow). 

Additional power-ups can be collected to improve the player's chances, some of the items available are : additional guns, larger fuel tanks, crystal magnets and impervious shields. Some of these add-ons are time-limited while others last until the player's current ship is destroyed. In the asteroid field, there are also 'popcorn' asteroids; small blue rock formations that grow larger and travel faster with each hit they take until they become large, non-moving objects on the screen. These obstacles must be avoided since hitting them will drain all of the ship's fuel, costing the player a life. A popcorn asteroid can not be destroyed. Hitting anything other than bonus power-ups and energy crystals costs precious fuel. Clearing a sector of all of its asteroids takes the player back to a screen and shows a preview of all of the cleared and uncleared sectors in this star system. Some sectors are marked as ""unknown"" and no preview is offered for these levels. From here, the player can choose which system they wish to tackle next. All systems need to be cleared before the player is given the chance to battle against Mukor himself. To kill Mukor, the player must eliminate each of the volcanoes with multiple blaster hits. Destroying a volcano causes Mukor to release bonus power-up items, and destroying all of the volcanoes causes Mukor to flee, returning the player to the selection vortices.

Later, after all other sectors have been cleared, the player will eventually have to face Mukor again and this time, the enemy boss will have to be destroyed. After Mukor has been destroyed, the game ends.

In the simultaneous two-player game, the first person to fly their ship into a vortex chooses the star system to which the players go. A unique feature of two-person play is the docking of ships : to dock, one player must transform their ship to the largest size while the other transforms to the smallest. By touching the two ships together, they dock and form one large ship. The player originally with the larger ship now controls the speed and direction of the docked ship and can fire straight forward. The player with the smaller ship controls a turret that can rotate and fire independently of the main ship. The dock is broken when the player with the small ship hits their 'thrust' button."

Not all sectors contain the crystal-bearing asteroids, however, and if the player runs out of fuel, a ship is lost. The game contains three different ship configurations and the player can switch between them at any time during a level. The three configurations are : Speeder (small and fast, but weak), Fighter (medium speed and strength) and Warrior (large and strong but very slow). 

Additional power-ups can be collected to improve the player's chances, some of the items available are : additional guns, larger fuel tanks, crystal magnets and impervious shields. Some of these add-ons are time-limited while others last until the player's current ship is destroyed. In the asteroid field, there are also 'popcorn' asteroids; small blue rock formations that grow larger and travel faster with each hit they take until they become large, non-moving objects on the screen. These obstacles must be avoided since hitting them will drain all of the ship's fuel, costing the player a life. A popcorn asteroid can not be destroyed. Hitting anything other than bonus power-ups and energy crystals costs precious fuel. Clearing a sector of all of its asteroids takes the player back to a screen and shows a preview of all of the cleared and uncleared sectors in this star system. Some sectors are marked as ""unknown"" and no preview is offered for these levels. From here, the player can choose which system they wish to tackle next. All systems need to be cleared before the player is given the chance to battle against Mukor himself. To kill Mukor, the player must eliminate each of the volcanoes with multiple blaster hits. Destroying a volcano causes Mukor to release bonus power-up items, and destroying all of the volcanoes causes Mukor to flee, returning the player to the selection vortices.

Later, after all other sectors have been cleared, the player will eventually have to face Mukor again and this time, the enemy boss will have to be destroyed. After Mukor has been destroyed, the game ends.

In the simultaneous two-player game, the first person to fly their ship into a vortex chooses the star system to which the players go. A unique feature of two-person play is the docking of ships : to dock, one player must transform their ship to the largest size while the other transforms to the smallest. By touching the two ships together, they dock and form one large ship. The player originally with the larger ship now controls the speed and direction of the docked ship and can fire straight forward. The player with the smaller ship controls a turret that can rotate and fire independently of the main ship. The dock is broken when the player with the small ship hits their 'thrust' button."

448;bnzabros;bnzabros;"Bonanza Bros. (c) 1990 Sega.
";"Bonanza Bros. is a strategic platform shoot-em-up with one or two players taking on the roles of Robo and Mobo, two cat-burgling brothers who must negotiate scrolling platform-based levels and steal a set number of valuable items, before making their way to the roof to escape in a waiting airship. The location of the items is highlighted on a cut-away map displayed in the middle of the screen and each stage must be completed within a set time limit.

The game's 2D platforms are displayed using forced-perspective 3D, this allows both the players and enemies to move between the front and back of the platforms. The game's enemies have a limited field of vision, making it possible for players to hide from them by ducking into alcoves, stairwells and other background scenery. Players can walk, jump and shoot and enemies can be neutralized either by being shot, or by slamming doors against them. They will only remain stunned for a few seconds, however. 

""Bonanza Bros."" promotes the use of stealth, with enemies alerted by sounds or by players entering their field of vision. Once alerted, enemies will either hide, call for help or fire at the players. On some stages, hazardous items litter the ground that should either be avoided or jumped over. These include discarded Coke cans, banana skins and garden rakes and if players walk into them, they will slip and fall, creating a noise and alerting nearby guards to their presence. Some guards carry a riot shield and can only be hit when they are walking away from the player. If players get shot too many times, or if they fail to steal all treasure items and reach the escape point within the time limit, the brothers end up in jail and it's game over.

The game has a total of twelve stages, with extra bonus stages appearing after every second level. These bonus rounds take place on a single screen and the aim is to collect treasure items from a number of ledges within a set time limit. Search lights constantly move around the screen and if one touches the player, the bonus round ends. Each bonus screen has alcoves that players can hide in to evade the search lights.

Each of the game's twelve stages is set in a different building. The stages are: 
* BANK
* MILLIONAIRE'S MANSION
* CASINO
* MINT
* DEPARTMENT STORE
* GOLD MINE
* JEWELLERY STORE
* LABORATORY
* DELUXE LINER (YACHT)
* ANTIQUE SHOP

";"Bomb Jack is a fast-moving platform game in which the aim is to collect all of the bombs on each level before progressing to the next. A variety of constantly spawning mechanical enemies patrol the platforms and airspace so the longer a player takes to collect all of the bombs, the more difficult progress becomes. 

Extra point bonuses are awarded for collecting bombs with their fuses lit. Only one bomb at any time has a lit fuse, and collecting twenty or more of these lit bombs on any given level will earn the player points bonus (see TIPS AND TRICKS for details). Jack is pursued around each level by the spawning enemies and when he gets killed, he drops down to the nearest platform, always landing on his head. 

A 'Powerball' appears at semi-regular intervals and moves diagonally around the screen. If the player manages to grab this, all of the level's monsters are frozen for several seconds and can then be killed by having Jack fly into them (similar to the 'Powerpill' feature in ""Pac-Man""). Collecting the Bonus 'B' symbols will increase the amount of points awarded for collecting bombs with their fuses lit. Picking up an 'Extra' symbol awards the player with an additional life, while catching the 'Special' symbol will give the player an extra credit. 

Each of Bomb Jack's levels feature one of five different background pictures, some of which represent famous historical landmarks. They are: the Sphinx in Egypt, the Acropolis in Greece, Castle Neuschwanstein in Bavaria, skyscrapers and a cityscape by night. While the backgrounds themselves are repeated as the game progresses, the platform layouts for each level are completely different. At least until level 18, after which the levels are repeated. 

The basic play mechanic of collecting objects to clear a level, as well as the powerball feature, is hugely reminiscent of Namco's seminal ""Pac-Man""."

* In 'Regulation Bowling' the rules and scoring are just like real bowling, following the regulations of the American Bowling Congress (ABC). In all three games players can join in at any time during the first frame.

* 'Flash-O-Matic' is a variation on the bowling theme. In this game a flashing score value moves back and forth across the alley. The player bowls, and the score value stops when the ball first hits a pin. If the player throws a strike he receives that score value. If he gets a spare he gets half the original value. If he fails to convert the spare then he gets 1 point for each pin that he did knock down. Scores can go up to nearly 10,000 points!

* In 'BlackJack' each player gets up to 3 throws to attempt to knock down 21 pins. Each time the full rack of ten pins is set. All pins knocked down by all players in one frame are added to the pot. The player who gets closest to 21 without going over gets all the points in the pot, and the pot is cleared to zero for the next frame. If a player gets 21 exactly then he gets twice the value in the pot. If 2 or more players tie in a frame they each get the points from the pot (or twice the points if they each have 21). Players who do not get closest to 21 or who bust (go over 21) get no points for the frame. Knocking down one pin scores as an ace, and is worth one or eleven, depending on what the player needs. his game is best played by several players together.

516;bublbob2;bublbob2o;"Bubble Bobble II (c) 1994 Taito.
";"Bubble Bobble II, also known as Bubble Symphony, is the first direct sequel to Taito's 1986 platform classic, ""Bubble Bobble"" ('Rainbow Islands' was the first official sequel, but played very differently) in which one or two players take on the role of the infamous bubble-blowing dinosaurs who must once again fight their way through a large number of single-screen platform-based levels, trapping monsters with their bubbles before bursting them to destroy the trapped enemies. 

While the game plays identically to its predecessor, several new changes and additions have been made to breathe new life into the classic gameplay. As well as new bonuses, weapons, enemies and characters, players can now create 'Multiple Bubbles'; if the player holds the button down for a few seconds before releasing, up to three bubbles are produced at once. 

Other gameplay changes include Boss encounters that occur every five to ten levels. These boss screens are part of a new 'branching level' structure; once a boss is defeated, players chose to enter one of two doors to determine what level set they tackle next. 

In addition to the Bubble Bobble's original heroes, Bub and Bob, two new selectable female characters have been added, called Kululun and Cororon. Each of the four dinosaurs possess different gameplay attributes, which are as follows : 
* Bubblun - Average 
* Bobblun - Faster speed 
* Kululun - Bubbles float the furthest 
* Cororon - Bubbles float the fastest 

The game's graphics are, inevitably, a vast improvement over the original game; with lush, colourfully rendered backgrounds and detailed, smoothly animated sprites doing full justice to Bubble Bobble's legendary characters. The game also features cameo appearances by a number of characters from many other Taito classics. 

The game features multiple endings."
517;bublbobl;bublbobl1;"Bubble Bobble (c) 1986 Taito Corp.
";"One or two players take on the role of Bub and Bob, two cute dinosaurs who must battle through 100 platform-packed single screen levels to rescue their girlfriends. Bub and Bob are armed only with the ability to blow bubbles, in which the game's many enemies can be trapped and killed. The bubbles can also be used as temporary platforms, to help the dinosaurs reach previously inaccessible areas of a level. 

Any trapped enemies who are not killed quickly enough will turn red and escape their bubble prison. These angry enemies are much faster than before, making them harder to kill. Enemies also become angry if players are taking too long to complete a level. Defeated enemies are turned into bonus fruit items that can be collected for points. 

On many levels, bubbles containing fire, water or a lightning bolt appear. These can be burst by players to release their contents and destroy enemies. The fire bubble drops flames down onto the nearest platform, killing any enemies it hits. The lightning bubble sends a lightning bolt horizontally across the screen, its direction dictated by whichever side of the bubble the player hits to burst it. The water bubble releases a torrent of water that will quickly flow down the platforms to the bottom of the screen. Any enemies caught in the flow are killed. 

Bubbles containing letters also appear. The aim is to collect the letters needed to speel the word E.X.T.E.N.D. which earns players an extra life. 

The game's simple-yet-involving game-play saw Bubble Bobble become an instant classic. Its two-player co-operative mode, coupled with the incredible amount of hidden secrets and potential for strategic play - unheard of in the platform genre - would set the standard by which all other platform games were judged."

543;cabal;cabal;"Cabal (c) 1988 TAD Corporation.
";"Cabal is a war themed shoot-em-up with one or simultaneous two-player gameplay in which two unnamed commandos must battle through five different stages - each containing four screens of play - to reach and defeat an evil dictator.

The game is an into-the-screen shooter with the action viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective. The commandos can move left and right to avoid incoming fire while the enemies themselves are targeted by moving an on-screen cross-hair over them and pressing fire. If the fire button is held down, the commando remains static, allowing for more accurate targeting of the cross-hair. While static, the commandos are vulnerable to incoming enemy fire.

Initially, the commandos are armed with only a standard single-shot gun (albeit with unlimited-ammunition) and a limited number of grenades, but additional grenades and weapon power-ups can be earned as play progresses.

As well as enemy troops, vehicles such as tanks, armoured cars and helicopters also appear and take numerous shots to destroy. When destroyed or killed, some on-screen targets release points bonuses and weapon power-ups that drop to the bottom of the screen and can be picked up by the commandos. Weapon power-ups include additional grenades, a rapid-fire machine and an automatic shotgun, which has a slightly lower firing rate but has a larger targeting cross-hair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot.

Each of the game's screens is littered with buildings and barricades that can also be destroyed. This removes enemy cover as well as earning players bonus points."

";"CarnEvil is a rail shooter arcade game using a light gun. The game is set in the fictional town of Greeley Valley, Iowa. The main character's, Jacob (Player 1) and Lisa (Player 2), join a tractor-drawn trailer called Spooky Sam's Ghost Tour on its path through a cemetery. According to an urban legend, if a golden token is inserted into the jester's mouth on top of the tombstone of someone by the name of Ludwig Von Tökkentäkker, a haunted amusement park will rise from the earth.

Jacob leaves the tour with his friend, Lisa, and approaches the tombstone to find a golden coin sitting in a small hole on the tombstone, and surprised, Jacob inserts the coin into the jester's mouth, resulting in the legendary undead carnival rising from the ground. Jacob and Lisa take 2 [shotgun or shotguns] from the shooting gallery at the entrance and use them to fight through hordes of monsters, zombies, and insects as they escape.

First, Jacob and Lisa go to the ""Rickety Town"". There, they hop on the ""Slay Ride"" and battle several demonic elves, zombies dressed as goofy dinosaurs and flying bug like things and see Betty trapped on a ferris wheel. Finally, they battle ""Krumpas"", a Santa Claus like monster.

Jacob and Lisa then go to the ""Haunted House"" and battle through hordes of zombies, spiders, ghosts and bats. They notice that Betty is being chased by zombies. Jacob and Lisa enter the building and encounter Hambone, a large Jason Vorhees-like creature with a gatling gun for a hand. Jacob and Lisa defeat Hambone and proceed through the building. They find Betty being kidnapped by a Giant Spider upstairs and go after them. After going through ""the hall of hands"", Jacob and Lisa fight Hambone once again, who now has a skull launching grenade launcher for a hand, and is defeated again. Jacob and Lisa go onto the rooftop only to be pushed off by the car into a grave with a tombstone saying ""Rest in Pieces"". Jacob and Lisa at last fight ""Evil Marie"" who, after being defeated, falls on a tombstone.

The 2 then visit the ""Freak Show"" where they encounter Conjoined Acrobatic Men, Flies and Maggots with human heads, 8 legged monkeys, and a giant demon called ""Eye-clops"", a cyclops with more than one eye. They kill the monster and enter ""The Chamber of Horrors"", where they find Betty in a torture device. They leave to a Colosseum and fight ""Junior"", a Frankenstein-Like baby (or through the options menu, they can fight ""Deddy"", a disfigured Teddy Bear).

Then, they enter the Big Top, and fight clowns and circus animals to reach the center ring, whence they are taken to Tökkentäkker's zeppelin to face Tökkentäkker and his jester Umlaut.

After defeating Tökkentäkker and surviving the explosion of his airship, Jacob, Lisa, and Betty awaken a few hours later in a pile of leaves in the cemetery, and in front of Tökkentäkker's tombstone. Jacob then sees the token in its slot and, ignoring Betty's protests, puts it into the jester's mouth for a repeat performance."
579;carnival;carnival;"Carnival (c) 1980 Gremlin/Sega Ind., Incorporated.
";"CARNIVAL is a 1 or 2 player alternate action game that simulates a carnival shooting gallery. The playfield consists of three target rows, a rotating pipe wheel, a bonus message panel, and a 'special' target block.

The player uses a left right control to position a rifle at the bottom of the screen, and a shoot control to fire the rifle. Two rows of bullets at the bottom of the screen indicate the number of shots remaining to the player. Every time the player shoots, one of the bullets disappears from the screen. More bullets are given during the first round than the others, so, the inexperienced player will have a chance to enjoy the play.

The game ends when the player runs out of bullets. This can occur on any round. A round ends when the player clears the playfield of all targets. At this point, a special 'shoot the bear' sequence appears, and when this is finished the player proceeds to the next more difficult (and higher scoring) round. This is Gremlin's Multi-Phase design concept that keeps games challenging to players of all levels.

When a player completes a round (ending with 'shoot the bear' sequence), the screen flips to the other player. When the original player resumes play, he advances to the next level of difficulty, exactly as he would have if the screen had not flipped to the other player. This method allows the players to more directly compare their scores, since they are always within one round of each other. Note that the player who ends the game first does not necessarily lose--he might still have the higher score when the game ends.

The three target rows move in a horizontal line from left to right (top row), right to left (middle row) and left to right (bottom row). There are five types of targets. The rows move as a continuous band--the targets exiting the playfield from the right side of the bottom row reappear at the left of the top row. The point value for hitting a row target is indicated along the right side of the game--maximum points for a top row target, medium points for a middle row target, and minimum points for a bottom row target. These values increase from round to round.

Rabbits and owls are simple targets, which disappear when hit.

Numbered sign targets award additional bullets to the player when hit, as well as awarding the points indicated for the row. These targets appear only on the top two rows to make them relatively difficult targets.

Five small letters, B, 0, N, U and S are randomly interspersed through the target rows. At the upper right of the playfield is the word ''bonus"" spelled out is small letters. If the player manages to hit the moving bonus letters in order (b-o-n-u-s) a special bonus is awarded. The fact that the bonus is still active is shown by the bonus word in the upper right of the playfield. Every time a bonus letter in the correct order is hit, the small corresponding letter in the bonus panel enlarges to show that it has been hit. Whenever a bonus letter is hit out of order, the bonus panel disappears until the next round. The bonus panel reappears at the beginning of every round. The bonus value is determined by adding row target points into the bonus value. When the ""B"" letter is hit, the bonus value freezes for that round. This encourages waiting as long as possible before attempting to score the bonus.

Ducks are special targets. Whenever a duck reaches the bottom row, it is capable of leaving the row and flying down toward the player. If the duck manages to get past the player's rifle without being shot, it flies down to the bullet row and quickly eats 10 bullets. A maximum of three ducks can escape simultaneously.

The target rows move as a continuous band of targets, and no new owls, rabbits, or bonus letter targets are added once the round starts. 'More shots' targets and ducks are added during a round. The frequency of adding duck targets is tied to the round number. As the rounds get more difficult, more ducks are added as the round progresses.

A flying duck hit scores no points.

Bullets left over at the end of a round earn 50 points each.

The between rounds 'shoot the bear' sequence operates as a shooting gallery bear. Whenever the bear is hit, it rears up, roars, and continues motion in the opposite direction. Each hit speeds up the bear, and increases the point value, which is shown above the bear for each hit. When the bear leaves the screen (which it will always do eventually, since it speeds up with each hit) the between rounds sequence ends and a new round begins. As the rounds progress, more bears (a maximum of 4) appear on the screen simultaneously.

A special yellow-rimmed score panel appears in the upper left of the playfield, and stays on for random lengths of time. Four types of panels appear here, which either add or subtract points or bullets. Hitting any part of the panel border awards the score shown inside.

The bullet bonus panel is shown with a large plus sign, and a row of bullets. Immediately after appearing, the bullets begin disappearing fairly rapidly. When the bullets are depleted, the panel disappears. If hit, the player is awarded the number of bullets left in the panel when it was hit.

The score bonus is shown with the same large plus sign, and a score value. As with the bullets, the score value quickly decreases, until it hits zero and disappears.

The minus panels are similar to those above except a large minus sign indicates the number of bullets or points subtracted when hit. This discourages the practice of parking on the left margin and shooting--a miss will hit the negative target. These panels show a fixed number of bullets or points, and after a random time interval, disappear.

The pipe wheel contains 8 pipes of 4 different colors. A panel beneath the wheel restricts pipe hits to horizontally oriented pipes, and also indicates the point value for hitting a pipe. Every shot the player takes decrements the pipe value, except a shot which hits a pipe. This makes it advisable to hit pipes early in the round, when it is most difficult (since the player must shoot through heavily populated target rows). Hitting two pipes of the same color with two consecutive shots awards a bonus of four times the pipe value shown in the panel.

CARNIVAL is accompanied by background music. At the beginning of every round, the music begins at a slow rate and relatively low key. As the round progresses, the music speeds up and the melody shifts up in key. This gives the player a growing sense of urgency. As the round progresses, the playfield motion also gradually speeds up.

A small panel on the right of the playfield contains a musical note symbol. If the player wishes to turn off the music, he simply shoots the note panel. This makes the note disappear, and turns off the music. Hitting the panel again makes the note reappear and resumes the music. The note thus acts as a 'flip-flop' switch to turn the music on and off.

Every round begins with the music on.

There is a special case to consider near the end of a round: the player has cleared all of the targets except the ducks, and has plenty of bullets left so that he can simply sit and wait for the ducks. He would, in effect, prolong the game by refusing to end the round.

Theoretically, by hitting the ducks and 'more shots' signs, the round could be prolonged indefinitely. However, an internal ""doomsday"" timer in the game keeps track of how long a round has lasted. After a certain time limit (the same for each round), the frequency of new duck appearances increases dramatically.

The top 3 scores are shown during advertising, along with the player's initials. A player who scores in the top 3 is allowed to enter 3 initials by a special routine explained at the time of their writing. The rank is updated during the round. The player is both audibly and visually rewarded. There is a pronounced audible sound as the player's score passes that of another ranking player's score. And, they may watch their rank progress during the game.

CARNIVAL's basic play action is outlined below, as it appears in the game instructions.

Shoot all targets and pipes to advance to the next round.
Game is over when you run out of bullets.
Escaped ducks eat 10 bullets.
Hit B-O-N-U-S letters in sequence for special bonus. Bonus value stops increasing when 'B' is hit.
Hit same color pipes with 2 consecutive shots to score 4 times pipe value. Shoot number signs for more bullets.
Shoot the bear between rounds for extra points."

582;castfant;castfant;"Astro Fantasia (c) 1981 Data East Corp.
";"This is a ""Galaga"" style vertical shoot'em up with a few unique twists that make it interesting. You pilot a single fighter ship against an armada of enemies (sound familiar?). There are 2 different play screens that alternate.

The opening screen uses pseudo 3-D graphics and has a large red bit of what appears to be machinery (or perhaps part of a very large spaceship) as background on the bottom half of the screen. You can move your ship around anywhere on the red background, but the black area beyond is off limits. 

The game opens with a large mothership craft visible at the top of the screen, but your shots cannot reach it at this point. Red UFOs quickly begin attacking you, swooping in line formations from the top area of the screen. They actually scale in size as they get closer to you (a nice effect for a 1981 raster title). By moving around you will discover that the screen can scroll upwards quite a bit, and the enemy armada comes into view if you get near the top of your area. 

The armada consists of several rows of ships in classic ""Space Invaders"" style, except for the fact that they are tiny. You can quickly blast the armada away, as you have twin shots on this opening screen, and you can have several sets of them on screen at once (it really only takes a few seconds to take out the armada). 

After the armada is gone, the mothership begins spewing out groups of red UFOs (who make suicide runs at your ship), and a new green ship that actually fires at you. Be sure and shoot these green ships quickly, as they split into 3 separate enemies once they reach your movable territory. Eventually the mothership will stop spewing fighters at you, and the entire screen will scroll up (taking you completely away from your red 'home base'), and the game will begin the second wave.

The second wave pits you against the mothership directly. You will find that your multi shot is gone, and you can only have one shot on the screen at a time. The mothership has 3 areas that must be blasted away (a 'spark' on each side, and then the center which takes several more hits than the sparks do). The mothership does not flash, or otherwise provide any feedback on a successful hit, but just blast away, and eventually you will get it.

After killing the mothership, the game will award you bonus points based upon how much fuel you have left and then the game will begin again with increased difficulty."

";"Crystal Castles is an inventive variation on the maze-driven collect-the-dots gameplay first seen in Namco's legendary ""Pac-Man"". The player takes on the role of 'Bentley Bear', who must run around a number of ""castles"" - each presented in the form of an isometric forced 3D maze - picking up the gemstones that litter its walkways and platforms, before moving onto the next castle. 

Each level is populated by a variety of enemies, including sentient trees, gem eaters, a swarm of bees and Berthilda the Witch. Some enemy types move around the levels randomly, while others will actively chase Bentley. Gem Eaters will devour any gems they reach before the player. 

In addition to four-directional walking, Bentley can also jump to avoid pursuing enemies and obstacles. Many levels have platforms that can only be reached via an elevator and some screens also contain hidden secret passages and ramps, as well as 'warps' that move players forward several levels. 

Jumping over the trees will shrink and temporarily disable them, while wearing Berthilda's red hat grants the player temporary invincibility, allowing them to kill the witch should they manage to catch her. If Bentley Bear touches a Gem Eater while it's in the process of eating a gem, the Gem Eater dies and 500 points are awarded to the player. However, if the Gem Eater is not eating a gem when touched, Bentley Bear dies. 

Some levels contain a large pot of honey. A swarm of bees appears near the honey approximately every five seconds but collecting the honey pot earns the player 1,000 bonus points and causes the bees to appear less frequently. Other enemies, such as the balls, skeletons and ghosts must be avoided. 

If Bentley collects all of the gems on a castle, the player receives bonus points. A bonus is also awarded in the event of the player picking up the last gem on the level.

";"Strap on your vector spacesuit, and hop into your vector spaceship. It is a good old ship, and it has seen a lot of action. From navigating the asteroid belt and blasting aliens around the sun, to attacking evil space cannons, your little vector ship has done it all, and this time it has been upgraded with twin blasters. You see the ship in Cosmic Chasm seems to be the same spaceship that is in every vector game. You control it using rotation buttons and a thruster button, with a laser and a shield button thrown in for good measure, just like almost every other vector game around.

Now here is what you have to do. You guide your ship through a space fortress room by room. Each room contains a center section that slowly grows and will eventually trap you if you are not fast enough. You can shoot the center section to slow its growth. Each room also contains several exits. One of the exits will always spew forth a bunch of bad guys, shoot them, then exit to go to a different room. Between rooms you get to see an excellent tunnel animation. The idea is to make your way to the center of the fortress, blast the power core, and then leave. There is a map at the top of the screen to keep you from getting lost. This is a pretty decent game. It has a lot more to offer than the one screen of bad guys that most vector games have."

611;centipb2;centipdb;"Centipede (c) 1980 Atari.
";"Centipede is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster-scan monitor. The fast-moving game action takes place on a magical mushroom patch and includes a variety of insects that drop down from the top of the screen or enter from the sides of the screen, most of them to attack the Bug Blaster, controlled by the player. The Bug Blaster is represented on the screen by a somewhat humanoid head. The object of the game is to shoot at and destroy as many of these insects and mushrooms as possible for a high point score, before the player's lives are all used up. 

Player control consists of a Mini-Trak Ball control and a FIRE button. The Bug Blaster is moved by rotating the Midi-Trak Ball control. The Bug Blaster can be moved in all directions, but only within the bottom 5th of the screen. However, the Bug Blaster must move around mushrooms, since these are fixed, not 'transparent', objects. Pressing the button causes the Bug Blaster to fire individual shots upward, either singly or in rapid-fire mode, if held down constantly. (Only one shot appears on the screen at a time.) 

Game play begins with a playfield of randomly-placed mushrooms in a mushroom patch. A Centipede starts snaking its way across from the center top of the screen. The Centipede changes direction when it runs into a mushroom or either the left or right boundaries of the playfield. 

When a segment of the Centipede is shot, it is destroyed and a mushroom appears where that segment was shot. When a body segment is shot, the Centipede breaks into two smaller Centipedes, each with its own head. When a Centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it starts back up, but remains within the area of the Bug Blaster (the bottom fifth of the screen). 

If a Centipede reaches the bottom of the screen without being shot, it releases its tail. This tail changes into a new head. Also to provide the player a challenge, if a Centipede is still alive when it reaches the bottom, new heads will enter the screen almost at the bottom of the sides. More of these heads will appear as time progresses. 

A round of play ends when all Centipede segments are destroyed. 

The randomly moving Spiders also appear in the first wave. The Spiders can destroy any mushrooms they move over. This eliminates many mushroom targets for a player. Depending on a special option switch setting, the Spider moves slowly until the player reaches a specific score, and then it speeds up. If the Bug Blaster and a Spider collide, both are destroyed. 

Whan a Centipede with fewer than eleven body segments appears, a bombardment of Fleas starts. As a Flea descends, it leaves a trail of new mushrooms behind it. Fleas appear when a certain number of mushrooms remains at the bottom of the screen. This number increases as the game progresses, meaning Fleas appear more often later on in the game. The Bug Blaster must hit a Flea twice to destroy it; the first shot just speeds it up. 

When a Centipede with fewer than ten body segments appears, a Scorpion enters from either side, moving at a relatively slow speed. As the player earns more points, the Scorpion's speed increases. 

As the Scorpion travels across the screen, it 'poisons' the mushrooms that it moves over and changes their colors. These mushrooms cause any Centipedes that would collide with them to head straight towards the bottom of the screen, rather than continue snaking around. The Bug Blaster can stop a poisoned Centipede by shooting its head. 

In addition, these poisoned mushrooms as well as any partially shot mushrooms add 5 points to the player's score as the mushroom patch resets after a player loses a life. 

If the players are very skilled and earn at least 60,000 points, two things happen to increase player challenge : the Fleas descend at a faster speed and the Spiders restrict their movement to a smaller area at the bottom of the screen. 

An important new feature of this game is the operator option for easy/hard game difficulty. At Easy, the Spider moves slowly up to a 5,000-point score, and then bounces at a higher speed. It also changes direction less often throughout the game than at the hard setting. At Hard, the Spider moves slowly only for the first 1,000 points, and then speeds up. It also changes direction more often throughout the game. In either setting, the Spider always moves at a 45-degree angle or straight up and down."

";"Chack'n Pop is considered by many to be the precursor to the venerable game Bubble Bobble. The cast consists of two enemies that would later be seen in Bubble Bobble. Many fans of the Bubble Bobble series may find Chack'n Pop less fun to play due to its high degree of difficulty.

The game puts the player in the role of Mr. Chack'n, who must rescue all of the hearts that were stolen during a romantic interlude between him and Miss Chack'n. Chack is an interesting character with interesting abilities. He can toss two bombs, only one in each direction at a time. He can also effortlessly go from walking on the floor to walking on the ceiling. If the ceiling is low enough, Chack can extend his legs until his head touches the ceiling to immediately begin walking on it.

Chack must use his bombs to release the captured hearts from their cages. Once all of the hearts are freed, he can escape through the top right corner of the maze. Along the way, purple Monstas will be trying to stop Chack simply by colliding with him. Chack can use his bombs to defeat the Monstas, but the limited use he has over them makes the bombs an unreliable attack method. Once Chack spends enough time in a maze, it is not uncommon for Chack to become completely overwhelmed by the presence of the Monstas."
625;challeng;challeng;"Challenger (c) 1981 Centuri.
";"CHALLENGER is the newest video game to be introduced by Centuri. With its vivid colors and lively setting, it is sure to lure the most ardent player into game action.

The game consists of 16 sectors (rounds) of play. Sector 1 begins with Large Energy Rings floating randomly across the screen. The Spaceship must avoid colliding with the Rings, or it will explode into a starburst of brilliant colors. The Spaceship dodges the Energy Rings by moving right or left across the playfield, while bursting them with the Spaceship's 3-directional guns. Bursting the Large Rings (100 points) breaks them into Medium Rings. Bursting the Medium Rings (200 points) breaks them into Small Rings. Bursting the Small Rings (400 points) causes them to disintegrate.

The Spaceship is further protected by a feature called a 'Warp' button. By depressing this button, the Spaceship will relocate from the top or bottom of the screen to the opposite side.

If the Spaceship is in ultimate danger of being destroyed, releasing its Super Bomb will wipe out all the objects on the playfield, and add the point value of the objects to your score. Use of the Super Bomb is lost, if the ship is destroyed first. Only one Super Bomb is awarded per Spaceship.

At any time, a colorful Space Bogey resembling a Worm may appear on screen and proceed to chase the Spaceship. If the Worm is destroyed by Spaceship fire, or dodged successfully for several seconds, a 'clang' is heard and the Worm (500 points) wriggles off the screen in a bright red hue of embarrassment. If the Spaceship is caught by the Worm, a bell is sounded, and the astronaut is chased out of his ship in pursuit of safety.

At random time intervals a Bonus Bug will walk across the playfield, stop, and count down a Bonus Number. This number is equal to 100 times its value. To receive this Bonus, the Spaceship must link with the nose of the Bonus Bug.

When the Spaceship has survived 50 Seconds of playing time, it now enters the challenges of the next sector.

The remaining 15 sectors are played in the same manner as Sector one. The differences include that each succeeding sector increases in difficulty. The Energy Rings increase in number and move faster across the screen making them harder to dodge. Also there are several Space Bogeys introduced in the first 8 sectors. They also increase in number with advancement through each sector. Some of the Space Bogeys resemble Comets whizzing through space. Others resemble Spaceships from other worlds. Each Space Bogey (500 points), is an assemblage of bright colors, and when destroyed, burst with a ""clang"" into a spray of bright light.

Sectors 4, 8, 12, and 16, are alike as follows. A few seconds after the Energy Rings are broken into smaller pieces, they are pulled into a Black Hole in the center of the screen. While swirling across the game area, the condensed Rings expand and shatter into fragments which must be destroyed before they absorb the Spaceship.

When Sector 16 has been accomplished, it will return to Sector 9.

When Bonus levels are achieved, an additional Ship will be added to your game.

CHALLENGER INSTRUCTIONS
1. Burst energy rings to score and increase bonus levels.
Large rings - 100 points
Medium rings - 200 points
Small rings - 400 points
2. After all the small rings are hit, advance to the next sector.
3. In each sector, space bogeys appear and score 500 points when hit.
4. When the bonus bug walks across the playfield and stops, bonus points are counted down. To collect the bonus, link the ship with nose of the bug.
5. Pressing the warp button immediately relocates the ship from the top or bottom of the playfield to the opposite side.
6. The Super Bomb button destroys all objects on the playfield screen and awards total point value to your score.
7. One Super Bomb is awarded per ship.  Use of it will be lost if the ship is destroyed first.	
8. Game is over when all the ships have been destroyed."

As well as walking along the platforms and poles, the chameleon can use its tongue to pull itself up to higher platforms; and to escape from any nearby chickens. Each level also has a number of bombs placed at various points; the chameleon can hit these with its tongue to send them crashing towards nearby chickens. The player must keep an eye out for projectiles thrown by the chickens, such as flashing eggs.

If the nesting eggs are left for too long, they will hatch into a baby chick. The player can eat the chick for bonus points, but if the chick is left alone for too long, it will grow into an adult chicken and start attacking the player.

A level is over once all of the eggs have been collected and all of the chickens killed."

";"This maze game is quite similar to ""Pac-Man"". The player controls a caterpillar that crawls along the branches of a maze-like tree eating nuts and strawberries while avoiding deadly bugs and a hungry bird. The caterpillar changes into a butterfly after everything has been eaten.

The caterpillar must eat all the strawberries and nuts on each level to become a butterfly. Eating a strawberry temporarily makes the caterpillar invincible allowing it to kill the deadly bugs and score 400 bonus points ber bug. If the caterpillar remains still for too long, an invincible owl (replaced by an invincible bat in later levels) will appear. If your catepillar moves, the owl or bat will disappear.  If your catepillar remains still, the invincible owl or bat will chase the caterpillar, albiet not very effrctively.  

When the caterpillar crosses over a pivot branch, all the branches will rotate at once, and any bugs that are on those branches will fall off and score 400, 800, 1600 and 3200 points, depending on the amount of bugs killed. Keep an eye out for the flowers that will appear below the house - they will reward you between 400 and 3200 points, depending on the level."

";"""Chase H.Q."" is a checkpoint-based racing game in which the player takes on the role on an undercover cop called Tony Gibson in this 'Miami Vice' inspired game from Taito. Gibson drives a powerful unmarked police car (resembling a Porsche 911) along with his partner, 'Raymond Broady' and must chase down and apprehend various criminals.

The player has between fifty-five and seventy seconds (depending on the game's 'Dip' settings) to catch up with the fleeing criminal, then the same time period again to repeatedly ram into the criminal's car until it is too damaged to drive. The criminal's car is constantly moving away, so if the player repeatedly crashes or drives too slowly, the criminal will escape and the game ends.

As with Sega's seminal ""Out Run"", ""Chase H.Q."" features forked junctions offering players a choice of routes. In this game, however, the route selected is only a temporary diversion and dictates how quickly the criminal is caught up with. The player's Porsche is equipped with a limited number of turbo boosts, when used a turbo boost pushes the car to incredible speeds, at the expense of control. The turbos must be used wisely if the player is to have a chance of capturing the criminal before the time limit expires.

The game consists of five levels, each with its own villain to capture.

The game's villains and the cars they drive are:
1. Ralph, the Idaho Slasher (White Lotus Esprit)
2. Carlos, the New York armed robber (Yellow Lamborghini Countach)

- SCORING -

Clearing a square by walking over it: 10 points.
Collecting flags: 500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 points etc.
Defusing a bomb with 50-60 seconds remaining: 3,000 points.
Defusing a bomb with 40-49 seconds remaining: 2,500 points.
Defusing a bomb with 30-39 seconds remaining: 2,000 points.
Defusing a bomb with 20-29 seconds remaining: 1,500 points.
Defusing a bomb with 10-19 seconds remaining: 1,000 points.
Defusing a bomb with 1-9 seconds remaining: 500 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Collect all of the flags on the early levels as there is no great threat from the boots.

* Scroll bombs to the opposite edge of the screen so you can easily collect them and move back to your starting side.

* At the start of each level you get a few seconds where the boots can not move. Make use of this time to get to the first bomb.

* If two bombs are ticking down, get the closest one first unless the other is much closer to exploding.

* Move the floor away from boots to trap them.

* If you trap a boot on a single square, you can move the square away from underneath it, trapping it on empty space.

648;chiller;chiller;"Chiller (c) 1986 Exidy.
";"This is a gun game, and there are four different screens (plus two different bonus screens). The object is simply to shoot everything in sight (and to try and locate any hidden targets on the screen). The game is based on time, and the timer moves faster when you are shooting poorly.
* The first screen is a torture chamber. There are four (still living) human targets on this screen. From left to right they are; a man chained to the wall, a person in a guillotine (shoot the top of the guillotine to decapitate them), a woman strapped in a strange machine, and a man in a head vise (shoot the vise to crush his head). The rest of the room is strewn with blood and loose body parts. You don't simply shoot each target once, instead you shoot each part of the target, which reduces that part to a mess of blood and bones. This is thankfully the most disturbing level in the game.
* The second room is another torture chamber with a river of blood flowing through the middle. This one has five human targets; a man strapped to a board, a man chained to the floor, two people on stretching racks (shoot the wheels to pull them apart), and a woman hung from rope over the river (shoot a pulley to slowly lower her into the river to be eaten by crocodiles). Body parts will flow down the river randomly, and a man will pop out of a door from time to time to toss a blade into one of the helpless victims.
* The third level is a haunted house hallway. There is only one human victim on this level. It is a woman who runs from one doorway to another, shoot out the trapdoor to cause her to fall inside (and then shoot the beast that was chasing her). Your other targets are mostly assorted ghosts, and a few random body parts that will fall from the ceiling.
* The final level is a graveyard. Your only human victim on this level is a woman who is half buried in the ground, shooting her torso multiple times strips off her clothing until she is topless, and the last shot kills her. You other targets are bats, hands that pop up from the ground, and a man who pulls a cart full of body parts (you can't kill him, shooting him just makes him run away, only to return later).

The game repeats the levels over and over again until you manage to find every secret target on each screen (it gives you hints between the levels). Finding all the targets on a single screen earns you a bonus game (a slot machine), while finding all the hidden targets in the game gives you the second bonus game (a shooting gallery), and a free game."
649;chimerab;chimerab;"Chimera Beast (c) 1993 Jaleco.
";"A horizontally scrolling shoot'em up where 1 or 2 players control creatures known as 'eaters' which are capable of eating other creatures and taking their DNA, thus acquiring their abilities or characteristics.

Chimera Beast takes place on a planet which is described as distant and Earth-like. The planet is overrun by animals known as eaters, capable of eating other creatures and acquiring their abilities or characteristics. The player controls one of these eaters and progresses through the game by means of evolution, consuming microscopic organisms in the first stage, fish in the second, and so on. When the player's creature gets big enough to take on humanity, the goal of the game is revealed. The planet's humans have developed space travel, which the player must thwart, so as not to give the eaters a means of escaping the planet. There are two possible endings: one in which the player is able to stop the eaters from escaping the planet, and one in which the eaters do escape and, we are told, will eventually make their way to Earth.

The chief innovation of Chimera Beast is its power-up system. Instead of collecting gun upgrades as in most games of this genre, the player's eater enhances itself by eating other creatures and assuming their abilities and defenses. Instead of simply having various types of projectile weaponry, the game attempts to make these new abilities as varied as possible. Consuming a crustacean might give the player's eater a hard protective shell, for example, while an insectoid creature might offer a poisonous tail instead. The game even includes the ability to use cancer as a weapon.

Another difference from typical shooter mechanics is that the player's eater does not die after being hit. It has a life bar, which can be charged by consuming enemies. It is even possible to eat enough charge the life bar past its starting position, creating a larger eater which is not only more powerful but can take more damage as well."

After several rounds of targets, you finally get to go after some real live animals! The real live animals are of course, ducks!

";"Agent X, complete with trenchcoat, Bogie hat, and briefcase, hurries through a series of adventures and misadventures to retrieve stolen plans and destroy dastardly Dr. Boom's subterranean bomb factory. Our masked hero descends to the depths of Dr. Boom's laboratory in a special elevator. On each floor he encounters a series of conveyor belts that are moving explosives. A giant bomb ticks down the game seconds while devices of Dr. Boom's plotting, such as bomb converters, forklifts deflecting shots back at Agent X, robot guards, acid pits, and crawling eyes shooting death rays, challenge the player(s).

CLOAK & DAGGER is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster video display. You control Agent X as he descends underground floor by floor in an elevator to Dr. Boom's lab, located on the 33rd floor. Your main goal is to retrieve Top Secret plans that are surrounded by an electrical arc. To stop the electrical current, Agent X must shoot all the fiery nodes as he fights off robot guards.

As Agent X leaves the elevator on each floor, he must make his way carefully and quickly across the screen to another exit. Each floor displays a configuration of conveyor belts moving green unarmed and red armed explosives.  Agent X can pick up the green explosives. The red explosives will explode on contact. Some floors have marauding robot guards, death-ray shooting crawling eyes, and acid pits.

Once Agent X has the top secret plans in hand, he must make his way back to the surface. If he exits on a floor that was bombed on the way down, he will find a massive crater protected by node monsters and the previously mentioned attackers. If he exits on a floor that was not bombed, a superguard will join the other attackers to challenge Agent X. On the final level, rumors are that he will meet the notorious Dr. Boom himself.

At the center of the display, a double-coiled fuse to a giant bomb is ticking down the game seconds for each level. Agent X can light the fuse in a rush for bonus points, but must be able to escape that level before the bomb explodes. If the fuse has shortened on its own to one coil, it lights automatically and prompts Agent X to make a mad dash to the waiting elevator. The doors close just as a burst of light from the explosion is seen. The game's perspective now changes to a full view inside the elevator. Messages flash across the elevator to give helpful hints on the next level.

Dr. Boom has placed explosive mines on every 4th floor. On each of the preceding 3 floors Agent X can pick up a secret map box that will show him part of the safe path across the minefield on the next 4th floor.

Agent X's first goal is to travel successfully from one elevator to the other; his second goal is to pick up a secret box to get a map of the minefield on levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32; the third goal is to light the bomb fuse and escape before the explosion.

As game play progresses, Agent X may find an extra-life box and a mystery box that give bonus points, double speed, half speed, and occasionally, an extra life. Extra bonus points are earned for picking up green unarmed explosives or for skipping floors.

If Agent X succeeds in capturing the top secret plans, he must fight his way back up to the top level. The appearance of box compressors, crawling eyes, and other enemies are more random on the way up than on the way down. If Agent X makes it back to the surface, a free game will be awarded (depending on the settings of the option switches).

";"Agent X, complete with trenchcoat, Bogie hat, and briefcase, hurries through a series of adventures and misadventures to retrieve stolen plans and destroy dastardly Dr. Boom's subterranean bomb factory. Our masked hero descends to the depths of Dr. Boom's laboratory in a special elevator. On each floor he encounters a series of conveyor belts that are moving explosives. A giant bomb ticks down the game seconds while devices of Dr. Boom's plotting, such as bomb converters, forklifts deflecting shots back at Agent X, robot guards, acid pits, and crawling eyes shooting death rays, challenge the player(s).

CLOAK & DAGGER is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster video display. You control Agent X as he descends underground floor by floor in an elevator to Dr. Boom's lab, located on the 33rd floor. Your main goal is to retrieve Top Secret plans that are surrounded by an electrical arc. To stop the electrical current, Agent X must shoot all the fiery nodes as he fights off robot guards.

As Agent X leaves the elevator on each floor, he must make his way carefully and quickly across the screen to another exit. Each floor displays a configuration of conveyor belts moving green unarmed and red armed explosives.  Agent X can pick up the green explosives. The red explosives will explode on contact. Some floors have marauding robot guards, death-ray shooting crawling eyes, and acid pits.

Once Agent X has the top secret plans in hand, he must make his way back to the surface. If he exits on a floor that was bombed on the way down, he will find a massive crater protected by node monsters and the previously mentioned attackers. If he exits on a floor that was not bombed, a superguard will join the other attackers to challenge Agent X. On the final level, rumors are that he will meet the notorious Dr. Boom himself.

At the center of the display, a double-coiled fuse to a giant bomb is ticking down the game seconds for each level. Agent X can light the fuse in a rush for bonus points, but must be able to escape that level before the bomb explodes. If the fuse has shortened on its own to one coil, it lights automatically and prompts Agent X to make a mad dash to the waiting elevator. The doors close just as a burst of light from the explosion is seen. The game's perspective now changes to a full view inside the elevator. Messages flash across the elevator to give helpful hints on the next level.

Dr. Boom has placed explosive mines on every 4th floor. On each of the preceding 3 floors Agent X can pick up a secret map box that will show him part of the safe path across the minefield on the next 4th floor.

Agent X's first goal is to travel successfully from one elevator to the other; his second goal is to pick up a secret box to get a map of the minefield on levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32; the third goal is to light the bomb fuse and escape before the explosion.

As game play progresses, Agent X may find an extra-life box and a mystery box that give bonus points, double speed, half speed, and occasionally, an extra life. Extra bonus points are earned for picking up green unarmed explosives or for skipping floors.

If Agent X succeeds in capturing the top secret plans, he must fight his way back up to the top level. The appearance of box compressors, crawling eyes, and other enemies are more random on the way up than on the way down. If Agent X makes it back to the surface, a free game will be awarded (depending on the settings of the option switches).

";"Sega's answer to the legendary ""Tetris"", the rules of Columns are simple : a column of 3 square pieces - stacked one on top of the other - drops from the top of the screen into the play area. As with Tetris, the column puzzle pieces can be moved left and right as they fall, but unlike Tetris, they cannot be rotated. Instead, pressing a button will cause the order of the colored blocks in a column to shift by one position.

The object of the game is to place columns at the bottom of the pit in such a way that lines of 3 or more like-colored blocks are created (either horizontally, vertically or diagonally). When this happens, these blocks disappear, and any blocks resting upon them immediately fall onto the recently vacated space. This will often cause additional lines to be arranged, producing a 'cascade' effect. The key to a long game (and, ultimately, a high score) is to set up these cascades wherever possible.

While not achieving the same legendary status as the mighty ""Tetris"" (something that no puzzle game can realistically hope to achieve), the 'Columns' series has managed to garner a dedicated following of its own and is a respected example of the genre."

One good strategy is to turn around and head for the outer area of the screen (in four player mode), because everyone starts out headed for the center.

";"(Contra)

In 2631, a meteorite strikes the Galuga archipelago near New Zealand, carrying with it a dormant alien being. Two years later, a terrorist organization calling themselves Red Falcon takes over the island as part of their plot to invade the Earth. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat.

'Contra' is a hectic one or two player platform shoot-em-up featuring 10 stages. In addition to the standard side-view levels, there are also ""3D maze"" stages in which the player must proceed through a series of corridors inside an enemy base, destroying various sensors, in order to reach the core of the base.

Each player's character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character's movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player's character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player's inventory.

As players fight their way through the enemy-packed levels, additional weapons can be collected. If the player loses a life, they will also lose any weapon power-up they were carrying. Available weapons are:
Machine Gun: Auto-fire.
Spread gun [S]: Allows the player to fire 5 shots in an arc.
Laser: Will shoot a long laser that can take out many enemies in a row.
Fire Ball [F]: A gun which fires small fireballs in a corkscrew pattern.
Rapid Bullets [R]: Increases the firing rate of the player's currently equipped weapon. Works with the Machine Gun and Fire Ball.
Barrier [B]: Will make the player invincible for a few seconds.

The game consists of ten stages:
Stage 01: Jungle (horizontal scroll)
Stage 02: Inside Base 1 (3D maze)
Stage 03: Core of Base 1 (3D fixed)
Stage 04: Waterfall (vertical scroll)
Stage 05: Inside Base 2 (3D maze)

Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat.

'Contra' is a hectic one or two player platform shoot-em-up featuring 10 stages. In addition to the standard side-view levels, there are also ""3D maze"" stages in which the player must proceed through a series of corridors inside an enemy base, destroying various sensors, in order to reach the core of the base.

Each player's character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character's movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player's character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player's inventory.

As players fight their way through the enemy-packed levels, additional weapons can be collected. If the player loses a life, they will also lose any weapon power-up they were carrying. Available weapons are:
Machine Gun: Auto-fire.
Spread gun [S]: Allows the player to fire 5 shots in an arc.
Laser: Will shoot a long laser that can take out many enemies in a row.
Fire Ball [F]: A gun which fires small fireballs in a corkscrew pattern.
Rapid Bullets [R]: Increases the firing rate of the player's currently equipped weapon. Works with the Machine Gun and Fire Ball.
Barrier [B]: Will make the player invincible for a few seconds.

The game consists of ten stages:
Stage 01: Jungle (horizontal scroll)
Stage 02: Inside Base 1 (3D maze)
Stage 03: Core of Base 1 (3D fixed)

";"Championship Sprint is an updated version of the old Atari Sprint series, with the added ability for players to upgrade their vehicles as the game progresses. Upgrades are won by collecting the bonus wrenches that appear once during each race, and once players have collected four wrenches, they will be presented with an upgrade screen; allowing them to choose better traction, top speed, acceleration, or a faster helicopter.

Collisions with barriers should, of course, be avoided, as they invariably cost the player valuable time. Also; a direct, head-on collision can cause the players' vehicles to explode - particularly if the player is moving at speed when this happens. In the event of a car exploding, a helicopter will automatically airlift a replacement vehicle to the track; this replacement will retain any previous upgrades made by the player. Waiting for the replacement car takes precious time and allows rival drivers to gain a distinct advantage. Car replacement time can be shortened upgrading the helicopter.

Three years have passed since the events of ""Makaimura"" and Arthur the knight once again finds himself battling against the hideous creatures of Demon World. The demons have now seized the kingdom and Arthur returns home to witness the castle's lone survivor, his beloved Gunievere, murdered by the king of the demons, Lucifer. Arthur once again embarks on a one-man quest to destroy the demonic invaders and save Gunievere's mortal soul. 

Game-play is of a very similar vein to that of ""Makaimura"" - the classic run, jump and shoot action remains intact. Daimakaimura is, however, even more difficult than its already demanding predecessor. Arthur now has access to several new power-ups to aid him on his daunting quest, such as 'Golden Armour' which gives Arthur greater protection from the demons. Additionally, unlike ""Makaimura"", Arthur can now fire his weapons upwards instead of just left or right and, while jumping, can fire beneath him as well. 

The graphics in Daimakaimura are predictably far superior to those of its 1985 prequel, with highly imaginative level design and superbly-drawn, smoothly animated enemies all adding to the game's superb Gothic feel."

";"A horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up that was unique at the time for featuring a game screen that was three times wider than the conventional size, with the arcade cabinet utilizing three CRT screens to accommodate it.

In the game, the player flies an ornate fighter craft called a Silver Hawk. The craft is equipped with two attack weapons : Missile (forward-firing standard gun) and Bomb (drops from the bottom of the ship). The Silver Hawk is also equipped with the 'Arm' (armor); a green energy shield that can absorb enemy attacks without harm to the ship.

During the course of the levels the player must navigate the terrain and battle a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles. At the end of every level, players are greeted with the obligatory end-of-level boss. The bosses in Darius are often in the form of mechanical aquatic animals, such as fish or squid. If the player defeats the boss, the tunnel splits into two and the player must decide whether to take the upper or lower tunnel, both of which lead to a different stage. This allows many different paths to be taken through the game.

Power-ups can be obtained by shooting enemies of a certain color, with the power-ups appearing in the form of colored bubbles. Each color corresponds to one of the ship's three weapons :
* Red - Missile
* Green - Bomb
* Blue - Arm

If the player powers up a weapon more than seven times, the weapon changes to a new, more powerful version. This then becomes the player's default weapon, and can be powered up further. There are also two other colors of power-up bubble, white and orange; which can be obtained by shooting at certain sections of the terrain; unfortunately, there are no visual clues as to where these may be on any given level. These hidden power-ups offer the following :
* White - Gives a score bonus.
* Orange - Smart bomb that kills all on-screen enemies."

Another new feature of Darius II is the appearance of mini-bosses - large enemies that appear at the mid point of a level, possessing similar strength and abilities to those of the game's normal bosses (such as extravagant weapons, or the inability to be damaged without first exposing a vulnerable area). The mini-bosses in Darius II are in fact smaller versions of the bosses from Darius.

The game is set in the inner regions of the Solar system, and has the same branching level structure as Darius, allowing players to select their own route through the game."

";"A horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up that was unique at the time for featuring a game screen that was three times wider than the conventional size, with the arcade cabinet utilizing three CRT screens to accommodate it.

In the game, the player flies an ornate fighter craft called a Silver Hawk. The craft is equipped with two attack weapons : Missile (forward-firing standard gun) and Bomb (drops from the bottom of the ship). The Silver Hawk is also equipped with the 'Arm' (armor); a green energy shield that can absorb enemy attacks without harm to the ship.

During the course of the levels the player must navigate the terrain and battle a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles. At the end of every level, players are greeted with the obligatory end-of-level boss. The bosses in Darius are often in the form of mechanical aquatic animals, such as fish or squid. If the player defeats the boss, the tunnel splits into two and the player must decide whether to take the upper or lower tunnel, both of which lead to a different stage. This allows many different paths to be taken through the game.

Power-ups can be obtained by shooting enemies of a certain color, with the power-ups appearing in the form of colored bubbles. Each color corresponds to one of the ship's three weapons :
* Red - Missile
* Green - Bomb
* Blue - Arm

If the player powers up a weapon more than seven times, the weapon changes to a new, more powerful version. This then becomes the player's default weapon, and can be powered up further. There are also two other colors of power-up bubble, white and orange; which can be obtained by shooting at certain sections of the terrain; unfortunately, there are no visual clues as to where these may be on any given level. These hidden power-ups offer the following :
* White - Gives a score bonus.
* Orange - Smart bomb that kills all on-screen enemies."

";"The game takes place within a gigantic spaceship which has virtually infinite capacity because of its ability to manipulate time and space. The player must deal with enigmatic creatures called EVOL, which consist only of pure energy and need to keep themselves in capsules in order to maintain their existence in the world.

All of the characters in the game are designed to resemble microscopic organisms, both in their appearance and their quick, tricky movements. The player's ship undergoes over 10 types of transformations throughout the game, each with offensive and defensive maneuvers specific to their design. The sound effects used are minimal, but different types of sounds are used according to the type of shots or their speed. A sound resembling a long scream results when the player's ship is hit and returns to its weakest evolutionary state.

The player must progress through 16 different levels, defeating the boss at the end of each level. The player controls their ship using an 8-way joystick and 2 buttons (one button targets enemies in the air, and the other targets the enemies on the ground). The power of the player's ship increases as it evolves.

There are two broad categories that define how enemies attack. The first type only shoots in the forward direction at a constant speed, but the second type shoots bullets that travel at different speeds depending on its distance with the player's ship (the bullets travel quicker if the player is farther away, and slower if the player is close by). This makes it so that staying away from enemies will not necessarily make it easier to avoid attacks. The game's difficulty also does not change over time, and enemies do not become stronger as the player's ship evolves."

";"Dragon Breed is a superb and innovative side-scrolling shoot-em-up from the same gaming stable that gave the world ""R*Type"", Irem. Dragon Breed differs from other shoot-em-ups through its interpretation of the 'ship' that appears in other games of the genre; in Dragon Breed, the player controls a figure who rides a fully articulated and superbly rendered dragon. What makes this a particularly inspired move is that the Dragon's body - which is invulnerable to enemies and enemy fire - can be used as both a shield and a weapon; the player can move the dragon in such a way that its tail can be used to surround its rider and protect him from his enemies. Any contact the enemy has with the dragon will also deplete the enemy's power and eventually kill it. The dragon can also be 'powered-up' in a similar fashion to the space craft of other shoot-em-ups.

At various point throughout a level, small areas of land will appear at the bottom of the screen. These often contain power-ups and the player can fly the dragon down to the platform, dismount, and move around on foot."

* Energy - Restores the current character's life to 150%.
* Power-Up - Increases the character's agility.

There are 5 stages in the game :

Mission 1 - America - The enemies in this stage are typical thugs and bikers. The first area takes place in a downtown area of city. After defeating the first wave of enemies, the player will enter a warehouse, where they encounter bikers that will try to run over them with their bike. The boss in this is Jim, a red-haired biker wearing a leather jacket.

Mission 2 - China - The enemies are martial artists that specialize in flying kicks. The stage takes place in a single level set in a countryside near the Great Wall of China. The boss at the end of level is Li Cheng-Long, a Shaolin Martial Arts expert who resembles Bruce Lee. When he's down in life, he will wield out his club.

Mission 3 - Japan - The enemies are samurai swordsmen. The first area takes place outside a castle, with bamboo traps and enemies coming out of walls. The second area takes place inside a castle, where the player will face a few more swordsmen before taking out on the boss, Ranzou, a ninja. He attacks with throwing stars and smoke bombs and splits into three forms when he's down on his life.

Mission 4 - Italy - Consists of a single level set in the ruins of a coliseum. The enemies are roman archers. After defeating most of the archers, the boss Giuliano, a man decked in gladiator armor, will attempt to run the player over with his horse. After defeating all the archers, Giuliano will dismount at the end of the level and fight the player. He wields a long hand spear and can block attacks with his shield.

927;ddragon;ddragon;"Double Dragon (c) 1987 Technos Japan Corp.
";"Double Dragon is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players, featuring twin brothers and martial arts masters, ""Billy & Jimmy Lee"". The brothers must defeat the savage street gang known as the 'Black Warriors' to rescue Billy's kidnapped girlfriend, Marian. Standing between the brothers and Marian are four huge, colorful and varied levels; each populated with a wide variety of thugs.

Many of the game's enemies carry weapons (knives, baseball bats etc.) and should Billy or Jimmy manage to knock the weapons from the enemies' hands, the heroes can pick the weapons up and use them against the enemies.

The Black Warriors is made up of six distinct enemy characters- plus Willy, the game's final boss - with each differing in both physical appearance and fighting style. The members of the Black Warriors consist of the following fighters: 
* Williams - A street punk in a tank top. In addition to the standard punches and jump kicks, his signature technique is a body blow to the stomach. He also wields weapons such as baseball bats, knives and dynamite sticks.
* Rowper - A punk who wears matching-colored pants and shirtless vest. He wields all the same weapons as Williams, but can also lift and throw heavy objects such as oildrums, boxes and stones.
* Linda - Female punk who usually carries a whip. She's not very strong, as she falls down to ground with a couple of punches or a single kick (because of this, she is the only regular-sized enemy who cannot be placed on a headlock).
* Abobo - A tall, big-muscled bald guy. His attacks includes punches, a standing kick and a body toss. He can also lift and throw heavy objects like Rowper. Due to his large size, he cannot be put into a headlock.
* Boss 1 - The first boss, a head-swap of Abobo with a Mr. T-style mohawk and beard. Fights just like Abobo, only with an added double-handed slap. Unlike Abobo, he does not use weapons. A green version of him appears as the Mission 3 boss.
* Boss 2 - The second boss. A head swap of the player who uses almost all the same techniques. 
* Willy - The game's final boss, armed, somewhat unfairly, with a machine-gun.

Double Dragon was a huge success due to the many game-play innovations it brought to the genre (see TRIVIA for details), but it demonstrates its final moment of inspired genius at the very end of the game. Should both players still be alive after the final boss has been defeated, they will then have to fight each OTHER. The winner of this fight will be the one who wins Marian's affections."
928;ddragon2;ddragon2;"Double Dragon II - The Revenge (c) 1988 Technos Japan Corp.
";"Following his defeat at the end of the original Double Dragon, Willy, the leader of the Black Warriors, retaliates against Billy and Jimmy Lee by murdering their friend, Marian, leaving the brothers with the task to avenge her death.

The sequel to Double Dragon is essentially an upgraded version of the original game, but with with a two-way attacking system similar to one previously used in Technos Japan's 1986 arcade game ""Renegade"". Many of the attacks and combos from the original ""Double Dragon"" are retained, as well as new techniques including the invincible Cyclone Kick.

The stages and weapons are redesigned versions of items previously featured in the original game. There are a few new traps such as a bulldozer in the middle of Mission 3 and all of the transition sequences between stages are now done with the character entering the next level via a lift, making it impossible to carry one weapon to the next area.

Most of the enemy characters return from the original Double Dragon, with some given facelifts, but the stage bosses are all new. The enemies are as followed :
* Williams - Has a wilder face and longer hair. He can now run towards the player and do cartwheels. He throws his knives in mid-air and sometimes carry a shovel which he throws towards the player.
* Rowper - Has a beard and eye-patch, but otherwise is more or less identical to his original self. He carries shovels and can sometime pick up large objects.
* Linda - She now has a mohawk and face paint. She can also jump off platforms and do the elbow strike against the player. In addition to the ball and chain, she also carries grenades and knives.
* Oharra - A strongman with a clean-shaved face. Replaces Abobo from the first game and has the same attacks.
* Bolo - A head-swap of Oharra with long hair and beard. Replaces the mohawked head-swap of Abobo from the first game.
* Jeff - Same as his original self, but now carries grenades.
* Burnov - The boss of Mission 1. An obese wrestler whose face is concealed with a mask. He grabs the player and throws similar punches in the face. After dying, he will stand up and yell, disappearing in front of the player and leaving only his clothes. In later encounters, he will revive himself at least once.
* Abore - The boss of Mission 2. A huge suspender-wearing strongman with Terminator-like sunglasses. His slaps and shoulder tackles do massive damage to the player.
* Chin Taimei - The boss of Mission 3. A Chinese martial artists armed with twin kali sticks. In addition to his energy-draining stick combo, he also has a jump kick and sweep kick.
* Willy - The boss of Mission 4. Looks like he does in the original game, but now dresses in red. He still uses the same machine gun from the first game.
* The clone - After defeating Willy, the player will have to fight their character's evil self. This clone has all the techniques the player has, but can also throw energy beams and possess the player's body to drain his energy."

Mission 3 - Japan - The enemies are samurai swordsmen. The first area takes place outside a castle, with bamboo traps and enemies coming out of walls. The second area takes place inside a castle, where the player will face a few more swordsmen before taking out on the boss, Ranzou, a ninja. He attacks with throwing stars and smoke bombs and splits into three forms when he's down on his life.

Mission 4 - Italy - Consists of a single level set in the ruins of a coliseum. The enemies are roman archers. After defeating most of the archers, the boss Giuliano, a man decked in gladiator armor, will attempt to run the player over with his horse. After defeating all the archers, Giuliano will dismount at the end of the level and fight the player. He wields a long hand spear and can block attacks with his shield.

Mission 5 - Egypt - The final stage is composed of seven levels, which includes a desert field, an underground forest, a trap room with stone pillars and giant hands emerging from the floor, a hall with a flying disc. Enemies include living tree men and rock creatures."

";"Defender is a legendary sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up - the very first of its genre - in which the aim is to pilot a laser-firing spaceship and protect humanoids stranded on the planet's surface from swarms of alien abductors.

A long-range scanner at the top of the screen shows the positions of both the humanoids and the attacking aliens. The ideal strategy is to shoot down the alien ships before they reach the humanoids. If a humanoid is captured, the alien abductor can still be destroyed, but the player must then catch the falling humanoid and return it to the safety of the planet's surface before it falls to its death.

If an alien is allowed to carry its victim to the very top of the screen, the humanoid will mutate, becoming a permanent part of the alien that captured it. This new and deadly mutation will then immediately join in the alien attack.

The challenge becomes more intense as action progresses. Fighter ships and their mines will soon join the abductors. There are also mother ships that must be destroyed; these are particularly difficult as a direct hit smashes the mother ship into a swarming mass of mini-ships that must also be wiped out. Throughout the entire mission, the player must act quickly or face possible destruction by the cosmic baiter, a fast and dangerous enemy.

Players have two escape options to use as a last resort. The first is the 'smart bomb', which destroys all on-screen enemies. The second option is 'hyperspace', which randomly teleports the player's ship to another part of the level. This is highly risky as it may place the player's ship in a position more dangerous than the one it left.

If all humanoids are successfully abducted, the planet will explode in a blinding flash and the waves remaining until the next planet is reached take place in outer space, and consist solely of destroying enemy waves."

";"A vertically scrolling shoot-em-up from the undisputed masters of the genre, 'Cave', Dangun Feveron features the usual Cave trademarks of intuitive, power-up driven gameplay backed-up with superb graphics and sound.

Dangun Feveron features a very high level of player customisation. At the start of a new game, players are prompted to select 3 different ship attributes; the speed of ship they wish to pilot (from a choice of four), which of the 3 rapid-fire weapons they prefer, and their preferred choice of sustained-fire weapons (activated by holding down the FIRE button). This allows players to tailor the ship to suit their individual needs and gameplay styles, be it a fast-flying speeder with widespread shots to handle enemy squadrons, or a ship with a lower speed that makes it easier to negotiate the swathes of enemy bullets that often fill the screen.

Another of the game's selling points is the capture-and-score system. Initially, every enemy destroyed is worth only one point. However, whenever an enemy is destroyed, coloured spheres appear in its wake, each containing a trapped, human prisoner. The spheres can then be collected by the player to earn additional points. For each prisoner saved, the total points gained from each enemy killed increases by one. For example, saving 56 prisoners means every subsequent defeated enemy is worth fifty-seven points. When the spheres appear, they drift slowly towards the bottom of the screen, before moving back up towards the top where, if they are not collected in time, they drift out of the screen and beyond the player's reach. This resets enemy-destroyed score back to a single point per enemy. If the player loses all of their lives and chooses to 'Continue' the game, the rescue count is reset to zero.

Dangun Feveron's final distinction was in its use of music and sound effects, with the game's creators drawing heavily on the disco sound of the 1970s."

";"An arcade puzzle game in which a single player must tunnel their way through a number of underground caves, collecting the many gems spread throughout the levels. Each cave is littered with rocks which, should they fall onto the player, will result in a loss of life. Carefully planned tunnels can be dug to manipulate the direction in which the rocks fall, however, which makes them an effective weapon against the many enemies that populate the levels. A number of red explosives can be found which can also be used to kill enemies and also to destroy any walls blocking the player's path. Again, like the rocks, these must be used carefully to prevent the explosion from killing the player.

In order to complete a level, a specified number of gems must be collected. Once a sufficient amount of gems have been collected, an exit will open which the player must enter to proceed to the next cave.

Diamond Run is heavily based on First Star's Commodore C64 classic, 'Boulder Dash'."

990;digdug;digdug;"Dig Dug (c) 1982 Namco.
";"Dig Dug is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster-scan video display. The screen shows a cutaway view of the land, most of which is below ground. The player controls the Dig Dug character who travels through and digs tunnels in the dirt. The object is for Dig Dug to destroy monsters by pumping them up or dropping rocks on them and to capture vegetables. 

Gameplay takes place on a cutaway section of the land. The characters are Dig Dug and two monsters - one is a round, orange monster with goggles called Pooka, the other is a green, fire-breathing dragon named Fygar. The underground area is divided into four different colored layers of dirt. Rocks are scattered in the dirt. The sky is at the top of the screen. 

The player controls Dig Dug, the hero of the garden, clad in white. He moves through horizontal and vertical tunnels. When Dig Dug digs new tunnels he moves slowly. When he is on the surface or in an existing tunnel, he moves faster. The object of the game is for Dig Dug to destroy all the monsters and go to the next round. 

Monsters are trapped in caves. A monster may get out of a cave two ways. Dig Dug may dig him out. Then, the monster chases Dig Dug. The monster may also get out of the cave by turning into a ghost. As a ghost, he cannot be destroyed. The ghost does not travel in the tunnels. He travels through the dirt, and can travel diagonally. However, he reappears as the monster when he goes into a tunnel. 

The monsters move faster than Dig Dug in vertical tunnels and slower on the surface. They destroy Dig Dug by catching him. In addition, Fygar can destroy Dig Dug by breathing fire on him. Fygar can only breathe fire horizontally. The fire can also penetrate thin layers of dirt. 

Dig Dug destroys the monsters by pumping them up until they burst, or by causing rocks to drop on them. To pump up and destroy a monster, the player presses and holds down the Pump button. It is possible to stun a monster for a few seconds by pressing the pump button once or twice. While a monster is stunned, Dig Dug may pass over him without being destroyed. If two monsters are very close together, only one may be stunned. The other will catch and destroy Dig Dug. 

Dig Dug must dig tunnels under the rocks to get them to drop. A rock may fall in a vertical or horizontal tunnel. A rock also goes through a thin layer of dirt from one tunnel to the next. In a vertical tunnel, Dig Dug may stay directly under a rock and it will not drop. However, in a horizontal tunnel, Dig Dug must move out from under a rock right away, or he will be crushed. 

After two rocks are dropped, a vegetable (worth extra points, see Scoring below) appears in a tunnel in the center of the screen. Dig Dug has ten seconds to capture (touch) the vegetable or it will disappear. There is only one vegetable per round. 

The game progresses by rounds. Round 1 starts with four monsters (one Fygar and three Pookas) and three rocks. The vegetable is a carrot. One flower on the surface (top right of the screen) represents Round 1. Two flowers represent Round 2, etc. As the rounds progress, the monsters move a little faster, and are better at avoiding falling rocks. In each round, the last monster tries to escape. If he is not caught by Dig Dug, he exits on the surface (top left). 

The game ends when all of Dig Dug's lives are used up. A player may continue to play at the beginning of the same round (level) by following instructions on the screen. He or she has 16 seconds to insert a coin(s). Then he or she must push and hold the Pump and Start buttons at the same time."

For this sequel, however, Namco also introduced ground-based charges. Players can activate the charges in order to join them up with other charges, represented on screen by the appearance of trenches. Once a line of charges is linked to two of the island's edges, the charges will detonate and destroy a piece of the island, killing any enemies that happen to be standing on the piece when it's destroyed. Players must be careful not to be standing on a piece that is destroyed, or they themselves will be killed."

Monsters are trapped in caves. A monster may get out of a cave two ways. Dig Dug may dig him out. Then, the monster chases Dig Dug. The monster may also get out of the cave by turning into a ghost. As a ghost, he cannot be destroyed. The ghost does not travel in the tunnels. He travels through the dirt, and can travel diagonally. However, he reappears as the monster when he goes into a tunnel. 

The monsters move faster than Dig Dug in vertical tunnels and slower on the surface. They destroy Dig Dug by catching him. In addition, Fygar can destroy Dig Dug by breathing fire on him. Fygar can only breathe fire horizontally. The fire can also penetrate thin layers of dirt. 

Dig Dug destroys the monsters by pumping them up until they burst, or by causing rocks to drop on them. To pump up and destroy a monster, the player presses and holds down the Pump button. It is possible to stun a monster for a few seconds by pressing the pump button once or twice. While a monster is stunned, Dig Dug may pass over him without being destroyed. If two monsters are very close together, only one may be stunned. The other will catch and destroy Dig Dug. 

Dig Dug must dig tunnels under the rocks to get them to drop. A rock may fall in a vertical or horizontal tunnel. A rock also goes through a thin layer of dirt from one tunnel to the next. In a vertical tunnel, Dig Dug may stay directly under a rock and it will not drop. However, in a horizontal tunnel, Dig Dug must move out from under a rock right away, or he will be crushed. 

After two rocks are dropped, a vegetable (worth extra points, see Scoring below) appears in a tunnel in the center of the screen. Dig Dug has ten seconds to capture (touch) the vegetable or it will disappear. There is only one vegetable per round. 

The game progresses by rounds. Round 1 starts with four monsters (one Fygar and three Pookas) and three rocks. The vegetable is a carrot. One flower on the surface (top right of the screen) represents Round 1. Two flowers represent Round 2, etc. As the rounds progress, the monsters move a little faster, and are better at avoiding falling rocks. In each round, the last monster tries to escape. If he is not caught by Dig Dug, he exits on the surface (top left). 

The game ends when all of Dig Dug's lives are used up. A player may continue to play at the beginning of the same round (level) by following instructions on the screen. He or she has 16 seconds to insert a coin(s). Then he or she must push and hold the Pump and Start buttons at the same time."
996;digger;digger;"Digger (c) 1980 Gremlin Ind.
";"Digger is a game that requires you to dig strategically placed holes within a maze format so you can capture and fill in over the invading creatures before they can attack and destroy your man. The maze format changes with every round played.

The creatures are confined behind a wall. In the first of three rounds of game play, four creatures are let out of the holding area through a gate. You must conquer these four before advancing to the next round, where you face six creatures. Your third round has you battling eight creatures. This process is repeated and the point value increased with each three-round victory. Also, creatures' speed increases each round. Any contact at all with the creatures will be fatal to your man.

While you are busy digging holes and entrapping creatures, the rest are behind the retaining wall scurrying back and forth. After about three minutes, the gates at each end will open and all of the remaining creatures will stream into the play area at once. However, a skillful player will conquer all of the creatures of each round and the gate will not be a threat."

";"The third and final arcade outing for Donkey Kong sees the giant ape once again cast as the enemy. Unlike the first two Donkey Kong games, the legendary character Mario is not featured in this game. Instead, the player takes on the role of Stanley the Bugman, a gardener who is armed with a bug spray with which he must destroy the swarms of insects that attack him and try to steal his plants. 

Each level has five plants that must be protected. Stanley must also spray Kong to force the ape to the top of the screen and complete the level. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

Stanley - Stanley's job is to defend the greenhouse that Donkey Kong has invaded. He does this with his trusty bug spray. When Stanley pumps his spray can, the spray travels a certain distance before dissipating so it's not useful against targets that are far away. Stanley primarily uses his bug spray to zap bugs or to make Donkey Kong scoot up the vines that he holds onto. In order to complete each stage, Stanley's goal is to either push Donkey Kong all the way up the vine using bug spray, or defeat every insect present in that stage. There are many ways for Stanley to lose a life, including touching an insect, getting shot by any of the bee stingers, running out of time, or allowing Donkey Kong to slip off the bottom of the vine. 

Donkey Kong - Nintendo's favorite simian seems to have been working out a little bit compared to his previous appearances. Donkey Kong attempts to keep himself above harm's way by hanging onto two vines that descend from the greenhouse ceiling. If left alone, Donkey Kong slips down the vines little by little, hoping to land on Stanley by surprise. Occasionally, he will reach over to one of the two beehives along side him and tap them in order to send more bees after Stanley. In the yellow stages, he even grabs coconuts from time to time and lobs them at Stanley's head. Starting in round 15, he will throw coconuts at you regardless of the stage. 

Super Spray - One time for every one of Stanley's lives, a more powerful bug spray will be perched on Donkey Kong's right vine. When Stanley pushes Donkey Kong high enough so that his hand is touching the spray, the spray falls to the ground, at which time Stanley can pick it up. The Super Spray lasts for a number of seconds, and continues with Stanley to the next stage until the full time runs out. When this spray is activated, Donkey Kong is forced up the vines much faster, Creepies die when hit, and Queen Bees die in one hit. It will not be replenished after it runs out until Stanley loses a life, so it's not a good idea to plan your strategy around it's use. 

Beespy & Buzzbee - These bugs are the primary attack force of the hive. Stanley starts the game squaring off against the Beespies as they swoop down and try to steal Stanley's vegetables. Starting in round 12, the hive switches to their faster and more aggressive soldiers, the Buzzbees. Buzzbees strike at Stanley more directly than Beespies. Either bee may or may not be accompanying a Queen Bee, but they are dangerous either way. 

Queen Bees - Starting in round 3, the Queen Bees of the hive will from time to time enter the fray surrounded by their royal escorts. One shot isn't enough to do them in, it simply changes them from red to blue. Even after you shoot them a second time, the threat isn't over. When killed, they split up in to 4 tiny projectiles that can kill you if they connect. You are only safe directly beneath them when they die. 

Buttifly & Beetle - Starting in round 6, the Buttiflies escape from the hive. They fly down along the side of the screen until they are even with Stanley, pause for a brief moment, and then charge across the screen in an attempt to collide with him. They disappear after round 16, only to be replaced with Beetles in round 18, who are bigger and a bit harder to dodge. Beetles do not pause as Buttiflies do, and attack immediately. 

Moth - The Moth is the mercenary of the bee hive, employed from round 24 and on. They move erratically, so it's slightly difficult to predict where they are going to end up. They will occasionally attack Stanley, or they will swoop down for his vegetables. Don't let them distract you from your efforts to force Donkey Kong up the vine, but don't get in their way either, or let them fly away with your plants. 

Creepy - This worm likes to play interference. In the blue and gray stages, he crawls down to the platforms from the plants along the side of the screen. Once he reaches the platform, he will wiggle back and forth and make a nuisance of himself. He cannot be killed by the normal bug spray, but he is quite allergic to it, and spraying him causes him to stop in his tracks until he finishes coughing. He can be persuaded to climb back up the plant for a while if you blast him with spray before he reaches the platforms. In yellow stages, three or more Creepies will slide along the vines below Donkey Kong and try to get in the way of your bug spray. If you hit one, not only with it absorb the spray, but you'll have to wait for it to finish coughing before he will move on and allow you to shoot Kong. They can be killed by super spray. 

Beebomb - After an insect successfully steals one of your plants, it turns into a Beebomb. Beebombs circle around a few times near the hive that they came from, and then immediately dive bomb towards Stanley. They are incredibly fast when diving towards you, but due to their direct attack nature, they are easy to defeat as long as you keep your eyes on them and time a blast of bug spray just as they are about to hit you. 

Vine Eater - These creatures appear when the bonus timer runs out. When the timer reaches zero, two of these appear on either side of the screen. They are oblivious to bug spray. When they reach the vines, they eat the vine from the bottom up to the ceiling. If they eat the section of vine that Donkey Kong is holding on to, Donkey Kong falls down and Stanley loses a life just as if he had allowed Donkey Kong to drop off the vine himself."
1018;dkongjo;dkongjo;"Donkey Kong (c) 1981 Nintendo. 
";"Donkey Kong is a legendary arcade platform game in which the player takes on the role of ""Jumpman"", who would later be renamed ""Mario"" and would go on to become Nintendo's mascot and a gaming legend. In this game, he must battle his way to the top of each level to rescue his beloved Pauline; who has been kidnapped by the giant ape, Donkey Kong. 

Jumpman is controlled with a joystick and a single JUMP button and must avoid the rolling Barrels thrown at him by Donkey Kong, as well as other enemies, including Fireballs, Cement Pies, Springs, and Firefoxes. Screens are negotiated with the use of ladders, ramps, conveyor belts and elevators. 

For additional points, players can collect umbrellas, hats, purses and other bonus items that Pauline has dropped on her way to the top of the building. Jumpman can also grab a hammer to smash Barrels, Beams, Fireballs, Cement Pies, and Firefoxes to earn additional bonus points. The hammer can only be used for a limited time, however, and Jumpman cannot jump or climb ladders while in possession of the hammer. 

On the Ramp, Elevator and Conveyor Belt stages, whenever Jumpman reaches Pauline, Donkey Kong will grab her and carry her off to the next level. (Exception: On the Conveyor Belt stage, Jumpman only needs to reach Donkey Kong's platform to clear the stage.) 

On the Rivet stage, Jumpman must remove eight rivets by running or jumping over them. After all eight rivets are removed, Donkey Kong will fall head first onto a stack of girders, knocking him out, and Jumpman and Pauline will finally be reunited. 

The game then starts over again with an increased level of difficulty. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

Jumpman (aka Mario) - This is the one and only Mario who will go on to become one of the biggest video game stars of all time. This is the game that started it all for him. His given profession in Donkey Kong is that of a carpenter, instead of a plumber.

Pauline - Jumpman's girlfriend and damsel in distress. She is stuck at the top of each screen awaiting rescue from the clutches of Donkey Kong. (When the arcade version of the game was first released, she did not have an official name and was just referred to as ""Lady""; she was renamed ""Pauline"" about the same time Jumpman was renamed ""Mario"".)

Donkey Kong - The most well-known video game ape and only character to retain his original name in future games. Donkey Kong has kidnapped Pauline and carried her up to the top of the construction site that Jumpman is working at. 

Hammer - Except for the Elevator stage, two hammers can be found on each stage. Jump to grab the hammer and use it to smash nearby dangers for points. It only lasts for a short time and Mario cannot climb ladders while he is holding the hammer. 

Barrel - Donkey Kong throws these at Jumpman on the Ramp stage. Many of them roll down the ramps and randomly drop down ladders that they pass. Sometimes Kong throws them directly down the building. 

Beam - These are the blue Barrels that Kong throws. The only difference between them and the Barrels is that Beams will turn into Fireballs when they reach the burning can of oil at the bottom. 

Fireball - These appear on every stage except the Rivet stage. They move about randomly and can be jumped, but it's dangerous to try because they change directions frequently. 

Cement Pie - These appear on the Conveyor Belt stage only. They passively travel along the conveyor belt and are harmful to touch. The only danger they pose is when the conveyor belt suddenly changes directions. 

Spring - These bounce along the roof of the Elevator stage before falling down to the bottom of the screen creating a dangerous but predictable obstacle to avoid. 

Firefox - The fire enemies that roam around the Rivet stage. They are even harder to jump over and they seem to track Mario a little more closely. 

Prizes - Except on the Ramp stage, some of Pauline's dropped items (namely her purse, hat and umbrella) litter the construction site and can be retrieved by Jumpman for bonus points."

Please refer to the ""Donkey Kong Junior"" (North American version) entry, Updates section, for complete details. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS -

Donkey Kong Jr. - The baby ape in the white unitard with a big J printed on the front, this is the son of Donkey Kong and he must rescue his father from Mario's cage. 

Mario - This game is quite possibly the ONLY game in Mario's long history where he is the enemy. 

Donkey Kong - Poor DK was captured by Mario after the events portrayed in Donkey Kong. Now he must helplessly watch as his son comes to the rescue. 

Snapjaws - These mechanical mouths must be avoided. Blue Snapjaws will drop down a vine and continue to fall off the screen, while Red Snapjaws will climb back up a vine and pose a more permanent threat. 

Nitpickers - There are two types of Nitpickers in the game. Small Nitpickers appear on the Springboard Stage and occasionally drop eggs on Jr. as they fly around the top branch. Large Nitpickers appear on the Chains stage and weave back and forth in an attempt to hinder Jr.'s chances at rescuing his father. 

Sparks - These volts of electricity patrol the Mario's Hideout Stage. The red variety follows the loop that they begin on while the blue version follows the vertical strips from one level to the next as they drop to the bottom of the screen. 

Fruit - Jr. will find various pieces of fruit scattered throughout each stage that he will pluck when he touches them. The fruit will fall and take out any enemy in its path until it reaches the bottom of the screen. They are one of the best sources for bonus points. 

Keys - On the first three stages, Jr.'s goal is to reach the key at the top of the stage. Once he jumps onto the vine or chain with the key at the top, he automatically climbs it to the adjacent platform and advances to the next stage. On the Chains Stage, Jr. must push six keys up the chains into the locks positioned at the top of the stage. When all six keys are inserted into the locks, Papa will be set free."

1026;dlair;dlair;"Dragon's Lair (c) 1983 Cinematronics.
";"Dragon's Lair is THE original laser disc video game, the video and sound sequences for the game are stored on a LASER DISC. This unprecedented game lets a player participate in an animated AND INTERACTIVE motion-picture experience.

Dragon's Lair is the first game born to the new generation of video games. This unprecedented game is the first motion-picture type fairy tale you interact with.

As Dirk the Daring, a player's goal is to rescue the princess. The adventures along the way are horrible and terrifying, but, a skilled and brave knight, like honor and truth, can prevail.

A player has a choice of 5 moves at any given time. A complete game of Dragon's Lair requires more than 200 correct moves. Timing is critical! Dirk can be too hesitant or too eager to make a move. Only experience and a good memory enable Dirk to complete his mission.

The game opens with the dark visage of a foreboding castle looming in the distance. The next thing you know, you are Dirk, running across the castle drawbridge. The gate clangs shut behind you, and your quest to kill the dragon and save Princess Daphne has begun!

More than 40 possible episodes will be presented to you. Some require many fast repeated moves; others will require fewer, more calculated moves.

Dragon's Lair can be a 1-or 2-player game. If 2 play, 2 twin knights engage in mortal combat with the same demons until they both die (use up their lives), or until one rescues the fair princess from the dragon's lair.

At the beginning of the game, if the player makes a wrong move and loses a life, a new scene will appear at random. Later in the game, a scene that is not completed properly is repeated until it is mastered. Also, when a player loses a life, the scene stops, the screen turns blue, and PLAYER 1 or PLAYER 2 is displayed on the screen, along with that player's number of remaining lives.

As you play the game you may find that sane scenes are repeated, but the image is reversed on the screen (the scene is reversed on the disc, not by the hardware).

Princess Daphne appears during the game, in distress and crying for help. She is unattainable until the end."

";"An update of the 1996 original, this game run on the ZN-1 architecture, hardware based the Sony Playstation.

1030;docastl2;docastle2;"Mr. Do's Castle (c) 1983 Universal.
";"For the second game in the Mr. Do! series, the clown finds himself in a traditional platforms and ladders game. Each level is made up of six floors (seven including the castle's ramparts) and all are joined by a number of inter-connecting ladders. The ladders come in two different varieties: vertical ladders, which are fixed and cannot be moved; and diagonal ladders, which can be pushed left or right from the top of the ladder. This allows Mr. Do to reach other areas of the level and is sometimes necessary to redirect the path of any pursuing enemies. 

The enemies in Mr. Do's Castle come in the form of unicorns, and as with the enemies of the first game, they will hunt down and try to kill Mr. Do. Replacing the 'Powerball' weapon of the original game, Mr. Do is now armed with a mallet. This can be used to temporarily stun the unicorns and buy Mr. Do some time to escape; but its primary function is to knock out the floor blocks that form each level's platforms.

Most blocks are marked with a cherry and collecting all of these will complete the level (on later revisions only, see Updates below). A level can also be completed by killing all of the unicorns. This is achieved by using the mallet to remove blocks and knock holes in the platforms. The unicorns will fall into any holes that the player has created; some simply fall through to the platform below, whereas others are trapped. Trapped unicorns can be hit with Mr. Do's mallet and knocked to a lower platform - useful for buying a few extra seconds for the player. If left alone, however, the unicorns will climb out, filling the hole in behind them, and transform into much nastier enemies. These new enemies cannot be stunned with the mallet and must be killed by dropping blocks onto them from the platform above.

Some sections of a platform have two 'skull' blocks at either end of them, with normal blocks in between. When both skull blocks are knocked out with the mallet, all of the blocks in between will fall to reveal wooden floorboards. This is highly effective in killing several enemies at once.

Each level also has three 'key' blocks. If Mr. Do knocks out all three key blocks, a large door opens at the top of the screen to reveal a shield which, when collected, turns the unicorns into 'Alphamonsters'. The Alphamonsters flee from Mr. Do and can be killed either with the mallet, or by dropping a floor block onto them from above. When Mr. Do kills an Alphamonster, its letter appears on a flagpole at the top of the screen. If the players collects all five letters, an extra life is awarded."

";"Dogosoken is the sequel to Ikari. It was developed by SNK, and released in the arcades in 1986, later in the same year that the original game appeared. Like the original, Dogosoken featured an 8-way rotary joystick that could be twisted in place to rotate the onscreen character allowing the player to face in one of eight directions while moving in another. The rotary joystick serves two simultaneous purposes. The joystick can be pushed in any one of eight direction to direct the players to move in that direction. As either player advances to the top of the screen, the screen will automatically scroll down. If the player retreats, the screen will scroll up, but only to a limited extent. The second purpose of the joystick is to control the orientation of the players. The joystick can be rotated clockwise or counter-clockwise. As the joystick is rotated, so too will the players rotate in the same direction. In this manner, a player can move in any direction while continuing to face one particular direction.

The objective is to defeat the enemy aliens using grenades and other weapons. The story directly picks up at the ending of Ikari Warriors. Congratuled by General Kawasaki for rescuing him, Paul and Vince return home to their native country in a plane arranged by the general. Expecting a hero's welcome upon arriving home, a mysterious storm appears and they are hurtled thousands of years into the future. They are met by an alien creature who says that the villain Zang Zip has taken over the land.

";"The player controls Domino Man, a bespectacled, moustachioed artist who must set up a chain of giant dominoes across the screen, to form a chain of dominoes which can then be toppled.

The dominoes must be placed on sites marked by black spots, achieved by simply running over each spot. Once all of the spots are covered with a domino, the chain is complete. The player will then have the choice of either knocking them all down to clear the level, or simply wait for a few seconds to continue to the next screen, in hope of completing the chain on THAT level, and so on. In this way, the player can set up several chains and knock them all down in one fell swoop, earning many bonus points in the process. Multiple chains are, of course, very difficult to achieve.

Domino Man's progress is hampered by a neighborhood bully who walks onto the screen and tries to knock over the first dominoes he comes across. The player must either try to complete and topple the chain of dominoes before the bully knocks them over, or hit the bully with a domino; causing the bully's trousers to fall down and disabling him for a few seconds. A killer bee also appears, and if it manages to sting the player, a life is lost. A bag lady and a boy pushing a shopping cart wander blindly around the levels, occasionally knocking over some of the dominoes. Domino Man can hit them, however, causing them to change direction.

Once a game is over, a poem is displayed on-screen to evaluate the player's performance on the game. For example :

Or so goes the verse,
You set up fifty-two

In Wild Ride, however, collecting them merely changes the 'prize' awarded upon reaching the level's goal. This can be one or two letters from EXTRA, or other items which simply award bonus points. When Mr. Do reaches his goal, he waves a flag while the bonus counter is added to his score.

The gameplay is similar to that of Nintendo's legendary ""Donkey Kong"", with Mr. Do starting each level at the bottom of the screen, trying to make his way to the exit at the very top. Mr. Do doesn't have either his Powerball or mallet in this game, but holding the ACTION button makes him run faster along the track. The trade-off of this is that his bonus points deplete much quicker. When all of the EXTRA letters are collected, the player is awarded with an extra life.

Each of the game's six levels is set on a roller coaster, with each having its own theme, traps and pitfalls. Wild Ride doesn't feature the intermission screens that appear in previous Mr.Do games.

The levels are :
Level 1, Roller Coaster. 
Level 2, Pirate Ship. 
Level 3, Three Elevators. 
Level 4, Castle on Screen. 
Level 5, Multiple Columns. 
Level 6, Six Rings.

After level six the levels are repeated."

";"Dream Shopper is an arcade game which was released by Sanritsu in 1982; it runs on Namco's Pac-Man hardware. The player must use a four-way joystick to take control of a shopper. At the start of the game the text YOUR PRESSING GOAL IS 10000 POINTS will appear on the screen. The screen will then cut to a shot of a room whose floor is comprised of 144 tiles as they flash up and give you a brief idea of what they all are; all except the 66th tile (which is the one with the apple) will then go black, and the Dream Shopper will have to walk around the room and use the Reveal Button to reveal the type of tile he is standing on. 

Yellow tiles are worth 50 points, green ones are worth 100, blue ones are worth 250 and red ones are worth 500 - and if the Dream Shopper should walk over that 66th tile (with the apple), all the remaining tiles will be revealed for a short period of time and he can walk over the strange-looking yellow creatures that are pursuing him for extra points. Once the apple has turned into a bunch of grapes all the remaining tiles will go black again; there's only one apple on each round. Not only must the Dream Shopper normally avoid contact with the yellow creatures, but he must also watch out for ""holes"" (which are indicated by the black tiles after he has walked over the 66th tile with the apple) - and if he reveals a bomb, he will only have a few seconds to vacate that blast radius (but you will receive extra points if one or more of the yellow creatures perish in that explosion). Also, if the Dream Shopper should reveal a frog, he will start to bounce around the room and you will receive extra points for every tile he reveals based upon his color. 

Once you have reached 10000 points, the Dream Shopper will have to make his way along a path comprised of copyright symbols towards his girlfriend's castle, while again watching out for yellow creatures and collecting dropped items like shoes, necklaces, handbags and rings as he goes."

";"Dragonninja is a sideways scrolling platform beat-em-up for one or two players in which the US president, President Ronnie (based on ex-U.S. president, Ronald Reagan), has been abducted by the nefarious DragonNinja clan.

Players take on the role of two government agents - 'Blade' and 'Striker' - who must fight their way through 7 enemy-packed levels to defeat the DragonNinja and save the President.

Each stage must be completed with a set time limit and initially the agents can only punch, kick and jump, although they can execute powerful spinning kicks and have the ability to charge themselves up with ""inner energy"" - by holding the punch button - to throw a powerful, long-range flaming punch that hits all opponents in front of the player.

Players will also come across weapon power-ups in the form of knives and Nunchuks. Player health can be replenished by picking up the drinks cans (resembling Coco-Cola cans) that also occasionally appear. Clocks can also be picked up to extend the stage's time limit.

At the end of each stage, players must defeat powerful end-of-level bosses, the first of which is Karnov, who was the star of his own 1987 video game of the same name.

For the game's 7th and final stage, players must re-fight all of the bosses from the previous stages, before finally confronting the Dragon Ninja himself. Defeating the Dragon Ninja frees the U.S. president and the game is over."

Another new feature of Darius II is the appearance of mini-bosses - large enemies that appear at the mid point of a level, possessing similar strength and abilities to those of the game's normal bosses (such as extravagant weapons, or the inability to be damaged without first exposing a vulnerable area). The mini-bosses in Darius II are in fact smaller versions of the bosses from Darius.

On the second level, the player must steer a floating ball around the screen, killing as many enemies as possible. Once enough enemies have been killed, an exit will open which the player must enter. The floating ball gradually diminishes and the player will have to drop to the bottom of the screen several times to get a replacement ball.

Additionally, Eliminator is also the only four-player vector game ever made.

It is a multi-directional shooter in which players must use four buttons to take control of their ship: two to make them rotate left and right, and two more to make them fire and accelerate. Players pilot a space ship around the playfield and must destroy alien drones. The ultimate goal is to evade and destroy the Eliminator, a huge asteroid base. The players fire causes any enemy that is struck (with the exception of the Eliminator itself) to rebound and careen off in another direction. 

There is only one way to destroy the Eliminator, fire a cannon blast down the trench into its center. This can be done directly or via a ricochet. Failure to destroy the Eliminator after a preset time causes the center to activate a drone that flies out of the Eliminator to shoot down the player with a destructive energy blast. The playfield becomes enclosed in an invisible barrier that bounces shots and ships off it, thus increasing the chances of death. Once the Eliminator is destroyed, the game restarts with a tougher set of enemies. The four player version allowed four players to simultaneously make attack runs on the Eliminator while trying to evade or destroy various other opponents.

";"Embargo is a one to four player blocking genre game. Each player must deposit a coin. There is a stylized map of Cuba (with a canal through the center) in the middle of the screen. There are four boats, one in each corner of the screen. If there were less than four players then the computer played the remainder. As the boats sail out they leave a continuous trail of mines behind. The players can control the direction and, with a single button, stop two mines from being laid in every twelve.

Each time a boat hits another boat, a mine, the screen edge or Cuba, it explodes and the surviving boats each get one point. This continues until zero or one boat is left. (If two boats collide they both blow up.) I believe there were four rounds per game. The strategy was to block off as much open water as you could while leaving a hole in your line of mines so you could double back and duck through it."

";"Escape From The Planet Of The Robot Monsters is a one or two-player game in which the players must rescue Dr. Sarah Bellum from Planet X, where her research facility has been taken over by the evil Reptilons. The game is played from an isometric perspective where players control their avatars using Hall effect joysticks. The Hall effect is the production of a voltage difference (the Hall voltage) across an electrical conductor, transverse to an electric current in the conductor and a magnetic field perpendicular to the current. It was discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879.

The player must shoot their way through a series of simple maze-like levels, releasing the human hostages along the way. Levers must be found and thrown to activate the escalators which allow access to new areas. Gems can be collected to increase the power of the player's ray gun, and food lockers may be broken into for a health boost.

At the end of each level the play switches to an isometric auto-scrolling sequence in which the player controls his character in a small spaceship, and must steer left or right to navigate through a maze of obstacles.

";"The third arcade outing based on the legendary trilogy of films; ""Empire Strikes Back"" eschews Jedi's Zaxxon-inspired gameplay and returns once more to the 3D vector graphics of the first game. Empire features four stages of play, with the first two putting the player in control ""Luke Skywalker's"" SnowSpeeder, and the second two in control of ""Han Solo's"" Millennium Falcon.

* The first level, Probots, takes place on the ice planet of Hoth, with the player flying the Snowspeeder over the planet's surface to find and destroy the Empire's search droids that are sending signals to the Empire warning them of the rebels' presence.

* The second Snowspeeder stage sees the player taking on the Empire's ""AT-AT"" Imperial walkers, as well as a number of smaller, bi-pedal ""AT-ST"" walkers. On this level, as well as the standard guns, the Snowspeeder is armed with a limited number of harpoons; these can be fired at the AT-AT's legs to send them crashing to the ground. AT-ATs can also be destroyed by shooting a small, highlighted area on the AT-ATs' head.

* The third level has the player piloting the Millennium Falcon and is a repeat of the original game's in-space Tie Fighter battle.

* For the fourth and final level the player must pilot the Millennium Falcon safely through a densely packed and fast-moving asteroid field.

Bonus points can be earned by destroying a certain number of targets. A JEDI letter will also be awarded in addition to the bonus points. Once all the letters that spell the word 'JEDI' have been awarded, players will have attained true JEDI FORCE, making them invincible to the Empire's forces for a limited amount of time.

In all levels of play, collisions with objects and enemy shots will cause damage to the player's deflector shields."
1171;esckids;esckidsj;"Escape Kids (c) 1991 Konami Industry Company, Limited.
";"An unusual take on the overhead racing genre, Escape Kids has up to 4 players taking on the role of an athletic runner and competing to be the first to cross the finish line in a number of 3-lap races. As well as running, each player has a limited number of 'Super Jumps'; these allow the player to leap over both rival runners and obstacles.

Money is awarded for finishing first, and players can upgrade their runner depending on the amount of money they have available. Runners can be given extra super jumps, an upgrade to stop the runner from skidding when going through a bend in the track, quicker recovery time from falls, or be made stronger (and thus less likely to be knocked over by a rival runner). Special items occasionally appear and can be picked up and used. These range from an item that causes a small earthquake (causing all of the rival runners to tumble along the ground, thus slowing them down) and a bomb, which renders any runner that runs into it unable to move for several seconds.

Each race has a total of five competitors (either human or computer controlled) and players must finish in first place or are disqualified. Any player who wins all three races in a round will be taken to a bonus screen. Here, the player's on-screen counterpart rides a bike and the player must collect as much money as possible."

The policeman carries a standard issue pistol which only has a limited amount of ammunition. In the event of the ammunition running out, players will only be able to kick their enemies. Extra Ammo can be picked up at various points in the levels.

";"Exed Exes is an arcade vertical shooter developed by Capcom. It was licensed to Memetron and released outside of Japan in the arcades as Savage Bees Memetron (licensor to the game). It uses similar hardware to Capcom's 1942, but it is more of a spiritual successor to Capcom's earlier shooter Vulgus. It takes place in a science fiction alien hive where you must pilot your ship through many stages protected by insects, some as large as your craft, and some even larger.

What made Exed Exes stand apart from other shooters, besides the high resolution graphics for its time, and the detailed use of parallax scrolling to indicate depth, was the fact that it was one of the earliest vertical shooters to allow for two player simultaneous play. Rather than waiting for one player to take his turn, two players could enjoy the game at the same time, and even work cooperatively to get further along in the game."
1191;exerion;exerion;"Exerion (c) 1983 Jaleco Company, Ltd [Japan Leisure].
";"Exerion is a vertical shooter that is operated with an 8 direction joystick and two fire buttons.

The ship is equipped with two kinds of weapons. You can fire the dual shot gun which can only release one pair of shots on the screen at a time, but has an unlimited supply, by tapping the first fire button. The single shot gun can fire a rapid stream of shots on the screen at one time by holding the second fire button down, but it is limited in ammo according to the number of charges indicated on the bottom. Each weapon is best used in different situations, in order to defeat the enemies which come flying down from the top part of the screen.

Due to the inertia of the ship, you must input any reverse in direction much sooner in order to cancel the ships momentum. This was not a common feature for similar games that came out around the same time, so it distinguished Exerion from other shooters. Because the Famicom conversion was played on a horizontal screen, the enemies appeared much closer to the player's ship, which changes the feel of the game since you have to react to the enemies' location much sooner."

";"The wild west-themed Express Raider is separated into two different game types; a sideways scrolling fighting sequence and a shooting sequence. The player controls a train robber, or 'Express Raider', and must try to steal the bags of money from the moving locomotives.

During the fighting sequence, the Raider must fight the bank teller, hit the coyotes and then jump onto the train before it speeds away. Once on the train, he must fight his way past other enemies and avoid various projectiles, such as bottles, bullets and shovels full of coal. Players must be careful to duck under the low signs that come along as the train is travelling. Also, once a train carriage is clear of enemies, a bomb will appear between the current carriage and the next; players must quickly jump over to the next carriage before the bomb goes off, otherwise the Raider will fall from the train and a life is lost. If the Express Raider manages to reach the train engine, the loot will be captured and the game will then move on to the shooting sequence.

In the shooting sequence, the Express Raider rides a horse and must shoot at the enemies that appear from the windows of a train carriage. They will shoot back at the player and throw various objects. Players can hit the DUCK button to avoid the enemy attacks. A woman will appear at regular intervals offering the player a bag of money, if the player shoots the woman, a life is lost.

They compete with each other to reach the Castle of Darkness and defeat Erinyes, so one of them might be able to marry the rescued Electra and rule the land Exvania.

The players must take up control of four medieval lords who are fighting for control of the land. They have to battle through eight different castles, and try to gain control of each one. When one of the lords wins a battle, he shall receive a medal - and once he has won three medals, he will gain control of the current castle (which means that they can be up to six rooms long) and the game will proceed to the next castle. The gameplay is similar to that of Hudson Soft's Bomberman series, the initial title of which was adapted by Irem for the arcade in 1991. 

The lords start out in the four corners of the screen and can only be killed by bombs, but a strike from the whips will temporarily stun them. The objective is to trap the other lords with bombs and kill them or otherwise force them to walk into the path of an exploding bomb. Treasure chests are numerous in each room, and can be broken with the whip. Each treasure chest contains a powerup such as speed shoes, boomerangs, extra bombs, larger bombs, and more. 

Every third room is a dragon room, in which an enormous dragon is seen walking around freely. They come in three different colors (red, green and black), and become stronger as the lords progress through each castle, In later castles the dragons begin to breathe fire (which is just as lethal as a bomb) and attack the players in other ways. If a dragon is successfully killed, powerups will appear all around him - and other enemies, like blobs of slime and possessed skeletons, appear as the castles progress. They cannot kill the players, but can significantly stun them in various ways and become more numerous with each level. When the time is down to 40 seconds the text ""DANGER"" will appear on the screen and Death appears, flying towards the lords and killing them on impact. 

When the time runs out, an evil witch will electrify the room to kill all the surviving lords. The final room pits the winning player (the player who has won the most matches and who controls the most castles) against the final boss, the witch, who attacks with lightning spells."

- TRIVIA -

There is a LOT of differences between each other, possibly due to the various disparities between having full dedicated hardware and a simple software conversion kit running off of older and possibly weaker hardware:
- A barrier upgrade exists in the dedicated version that does not appear at all in the conversion kit version. This allows the player to take several hits from enemies without dying.
- Many enemies in the dedicated version emerge from the background and move into the foreground. In the conversion kit version, they just simply appear from the edges of the screen.
- Almost ALL of the enemy patterns in each version are different. The dedicated board's enemy varation is a tad more scarce, enemies frequently appear from the right, while the conversion kit's enemies are a bit more varied in placement and design.
- The conversion kit introduces a pickup canister that can be shot to obtain powerups. These do not appear in the dedicated version. In the dedicated version, shooting a row of enemies à la Gradius will net you an upgrade instead.
- To coincide with the removal of the background objects in the conversion kit, the missile upgrade no longer fires into the background, and instead will trail onto the ground horizontally, making it more useful for taking out the laser turrets."

";"Fantasia is a ""Qix""-style adult puzzle game modeled heavily after the Kaneko game ""Gals Panic!"". It features photographic images of both Japanese and western models. The objective is to reveal 80% of the silhouetted girl's image within the time limit while avoiding the enemies.

To complicate things, there is a bar with a pointer at the top of the screen. If the pointer dips below a certain level (indicated by the change in color) the image will change to that of a monster. The pointer slowly creeps towards the monster side of the bar over time and moves dramatically towards the monster side whenever the player reveals a significant piece of the silhouette. Revealing the un-silhouetted part of the image moves the pointer back towards the girl side of the bar. If a round is completed while the monster's image is shown then the round must be repeated."

";"Jessica, the daughter of the city Mayor Mike Haggar has been kidnapped by the evil 'Mad Gear' gang. Set in the fictional Metro City, Haggar rounds up two of his closest friends, Guy and Cody, and sets out to battle Mad Gear's gang members and ultimately rescue his daughter.

1 or 2 players choose to play as either Guy, Cody or Haggar in this superb, sideways scrolling beat-em-up. As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, but with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's energy is lost. Energy levels can be replenished by finding the food that lies hidden in certain crates and barrels. Some of the Mad Gear gang members will drop a weapon when they are felled. These weapons can then be picked up and used by the players.

After the benchmark-setting ""Double Dragon"", released by Technos in 1987, Final Fight would become the standard-bearer of the scrolling beat-em-up genre. Featuring a large variety of distinctive, well animated characters moving through colorful and detailed backgrounds, and with a control system that is as intuitive as it is complex, Final Fight is still considered to be the finest example of its kind."

Fire Trap is very similar, gameplay-wise, to Nichibutsu's 1980 classic, ''Crazy Climber''. As the firefighter climbs the building, he must use his fire extinguisher to put out the fires which include burning papers, flame-gushing windows and moving fireballs. The fire extinguisher contains only a limited amount of water, so must be used it wisely. Certain extinguished fires, however, reveal cannisters of extinguisher fuel to be collected. Other extinguished fires reveal bonuses and, very occasionally, springboards; which shoot the player higher up the skyscraper.

The firefighter's ultimate aim is to reach the roof of the skyscraper and rescue a young woman who is trapped there. As the firefighter reaches the roof, a giant fireball appears and circles the tower; this must be either avoided or extinguished. After the firefighter has rescued the woman, he must fly down the building with his jet pack and extinguish any fires remaining on the building; before finally landing safely on the ground.

";The object of the game is for the player to maneuver his white robot in 1 of 4 directions within a maze, capture a red character robot as they move about the maze, and race to the center to change the 9 white balls located there to red. The player may only change one white ball to red at a time after he has captured a red robot, and must evade 4 chaser monsters in the process. Bonus point may be earned when capturing the elusive 'red king' that appears on the screen. Capture him and momentarily immobilize the chasers, but do not come in contact with the yellow robots--or your much-needed red robots will be changed to white and force you to change strategy. Play is over when the chasers have captured all of the player's robots. But, should the player be successful in changing all of the balls in the center to red, the pattern clears and a different challenge is presented. A 3x3 or 4x4 tri-colored pattern will appear at the bottom of the screen and a slightly different tri-colored cube of corresponding size will appear at the center of the screen. The player may earn bonus points by moving the directional arrow and rearranging the colors of the cube at the center of the screen to match the sample pattern presented at the bottom of the screen. The player is given 90 seconds to rearrange the cube as many times as he can. Action returns to the maze whether you win or lose the cube challenge. All in all, an exciting and challenging game where patience and skill are required.

The game uses analog controls to simulate both pitching and hitting, so a smooth motion of the joystick will produce the best results. The pitcher is the only person on the field besides the base runners, so it is often best to make for one base further than the one you would have thrown the ball to (the pitcher has to run after the batter). The game only lasts for 1 or 2 innings (depending on how it is set), so each at bat really counts.

";"Frogger is a 1- or 2-player game in which players move their frog from the bottom to the top of the screen. This is achieved by overcoming a number of hazards without getting run over or drowned. 

The first half of the screen is a bi-directional flow of traffic including busses, cars and racecars. Players must avoid these vehicles. Frogs can move safely with the flow of traffic to make their way to the second half of the screen, which consists of a river with fast moving logs and sinkable turtles. Frogs must hop on the backs of the logs and the turtles to get to the home base at the top of the screen. At random times throughout the game play, a lady frog will appear on a log. Bonus points are scored if the frog successfully hops on the back of the lady frog and escorts her safely home. A fly will also appear randomly in a home base. Bonus points can be scored if the frog hops in the home base when the fly is present. Sinking turtles also swiftly move across the river with the logs. If a frog is unsuccessful in hopping on a turtle's back, the frog will sink and drown. Crocodiles, snakes, and otters also roam the moving river waiting to eat frogs on their way up to the home base. Players can hop on their back (except the snake, whose touch is deadly), but they must avoid their open mouths. The frog must be lined up perfectly to enter one of the 5 home bases. Players must maneuver the frogs to their home base within the allotted time (60 beats on the timer). 

The frog can move vertically or horizontally by maneuvering the joystick. Players must maneuver the frog swiftly and precisely without getting run over, drowned, or eaten by the creatures that roam the flowing river. Avoiding traffic, deadly snakes, otters, crocodiles, and the treacherous diving turtles make game action stimulating in Frogger."

";"Taisen Idol-Mahjong Final Romance 2 is strip mahjong game featuring nine different girls with three strip sequences each.

Before facing each opponent, the player may buy cheat items to help him in the following rounds against that girl. Funds for the store come from the players winnings in the previous rounds and roll over across continues.

A strip sequence is shown every time the player wins a hand. Strip sequences consist of scrolling, still images of the girl with limited animation of facial expressions. If a player depletes an opponents betting funds, then the game will advance through all of the strip sequences for that opponent.

Occasionally, after defeating an opponent, the player is given the opportunity to play a mini-game of high-low. The player is shown a tile and must guess if the next tile will be higher or lower than the tile shown.  If the player wins all three rounds, he is given a cheat item.

The player looses the game once all of his betting funds are depleted. Upon continuing the player keeps any unused cheat items and may buy more items from the store, but all of the player's wins against the current opponent are wiped out."

Moving faster, he races past trees that hide the enemy who now unleash an ambush barrage of bullets and bombs. Even the ground he races over has been booby-trapped with land mines.

If the player successfully makes it through this deadly obstacle course, he meets an even greater challenge... the enemy is attacking with tanks! His gun now useless, the player can stand and fight with grenades or leap into his own tank (special Tank button) and counter attack.

The battle rages on all fronts as the player fights for his life, racing for cover behind brick walls while outrunning grenades thrown by soldiers in fox holes. It's all-out war when the player jumps from his tank into a larger one with greater firepower.

Now comes the final test of victory as the enemy's fort looms in sight. The player must leap from the tank and run through a hail of bullets to throw one final grenade. The white flag heralds total victory!"

1353;galag88j;galaga88j;"Galaga '88 (c) 1987 Namco.
";"Galaga '88 is an updated version of the old favorite, ""Galaga"", with more invaders and more player firepower. Galaga '88 gives players a chance to once again repel the invaders from the Galagan Kingdom. One or two players can try their hand at fighting the invaders. This time the Galagans have four more allies, each with unique weapons and defenses that a player must overcome. 

By destroying special enemies or obstacles the player can get 'items'. When a player has two items, they can warp to another dimension to confront more Galagan ships with new strategies. In the Challenging Stages (labelled in this game as 'That's Galactic Dancin'), the player shoots down as many invaders as possible as the Galagans dance to a waltz, tango, march or jazz tune. 

The player selects single or dual ship power. The objective is to destroy all the Galagan foes in each of the 29 sectors of the galaxy, with each sector more difficult than the last. 

Unique Features : 
* More opponents. In addition to Boss, Goei and Zako, the original Galagan crew, Don, Nin, Ban, and Gan have been added. Each of the Galagans has a unique way of challenging the players. 
* Different types of ships. Players can choose single or dual ships (if the game option is set for dual and single). When the player retrieves a dual ship from the Boss's tractor beam, it turns into a triple ship with ten times the power of a single ship. 
* Challenging Stages. In the 'That's Galactic Dancin' stages, the Galagan invaders dance to a waltz, tango, Sousa march or jazz tune, while the player shoots down Galagans to earn bonus points. 
* Warping to a new dimension. By destroying particular enemies or obstacles and capturing two of their items, the player can warp to the next dimension. 
* Player challenge. Each dimension has different mix of Galagans with different strategies to be overcome. 
* Win back captured ships. The player can win back ships captured in the Boss Galaga's tractor beam. When the player destroys the Boss, the ships are released. If the player retrieves them, the ships become dual ships if they were single and triple if they were dual. 
* High Score Mode. Upon completing a game, a player can enter his initials if they are among the top eight scorers on the game."
1354;galaga;galagao;"Galaga (c) 1981 Namco. 
";"Galaga is a single-screen shoot-em-up in which the player controls a 'Fighter' spaceship and must defend the home planet against the on-coming hordes of alien invaders called ""Galagans"". The Fighter can only move left and right along the bottom of the screen. 

Galagans fly onto the screen in a variety of formations before forming troop lines at the top of the screen. Once all troop lines are formed the Galagans separate and start attacking the player's Fighter in ones, twos and threes. The top-line Boss Galaga need to be shot twice before they are destroyed. 

The Boss Galaga has a tractor beam that can capture the player's Fighter. A captured Fighter changes color from white to red and stays with that particular Boss until it is destroyed. The Fighter can be retrieved by destroying the Boss that captured it, but players must be careful not to destroy the captured Fighter itself, or that Fighter is lost. A rescued Fighter changes color back to white and links up with the player's current Fighter, doubling its fire power. 

As players progress through each screen, the speed and number of alien attacks increases. Alien formations also become more complex, making the aliens harder to shoot. 

Bonus Fighters are awarded periodically throughout the game, as players reach specific point values, as dictated by the 'Bonus Life' dip switch setting. Each enemy ship also has an assigned point value (see Scoring below). 

The alien troop lines that form at the top of the screen are, from top to bottom: Boss Galaga (in one row of four), Butterflies (red/white bug ships, in two rows of eight, directly below the Boss Galaga), and Bees (blue/yellow bug ships, in two rows of ten, directly below the Butterflies). 

In Stage 1, the enemies do not drop bombs as they fly onto the screen. However, they do so in most of the later stages. 

From Stage 4 onwards, a squadron of special bonus enemies called ""transforms"" start appearing. They're called transforms because Bees will begin pulsating and move out of formation to change into these bonus enemies. They appear in the form of yellow scorpions in Stages 4, 5, and 6, green 'Spy Ships' from ""Bosconian"" in Stages 8, 9, and 10, and Galaxian Flagships in Stages 12, 13, and 14. After that, the three different transforms are repeated in the same order. Transforms are always worthwhile targets because they are not very aggressive and are worth more than the other enemies. If all three transforms are destroyed, extra bonus points will be awarded. 

Galaga also features CHALLENGING STAGES, these consist of 40 Galagans that fly onto the screen in formations but do not drop any bombs. The object is to shoot as many of them as possible before they leave the play area. When an entire formation of eight Galagans is destroyed, bonus points are added to the player's score. If all 40 aliens are destroyed, players are awarded a special bonus of 10,000 points. 

Two new gameplay features Galaga introduced are : 
1) Players are given the chance to double their fire power. 
2) The game has a rapid fire (automatic firing) option, whereby the player simply holds the FIRE button down and the space fighter continues to fire at the Galagan army in bursts of two missiles each."

Movement is not confined to left and right, however, as players can also move anywhere in the bottom half of the screen.

The insectoid enemies fire down upon the player's ship, and both individual and groups of enemies will break away from the armada to make attack runs on the player. Most of the Galagans can be killed with a single shot, and shooting specific enemies will earn the player a tractor beam. This gives them the ability to capture one or more enemy ships; these prisoner ships will then sit alongside the player's ship and add to its firepower.

";"Galivan is a single player platform shoot-em-up in which the player takes on the roll of a 'Cosmo Police' officer who runs and jumps around a multi-directional scrolling cave system, destroying or avoiding waves of constantly attacking robots, aliens and alien ships.

The player starts the game as an unarmed human, whose only attacking options are kicking and punching, but picking up a POW item encases the human in a robotic suit and arms the player with a laser gun.

Collecting the blue POW items while in the suit awards the player with a powerful beam weapon for a limited time, while the red POW item gives the player a three-shot cannon. POW items are dotted throughout the levels and can also be gained by shooting the blue robot aliens.

The player's character has an energy bar that decreases whenever the player is hit. Should this fall below the halfway point, the robot suit will be lost and the player will once again be an unarmed human.

Collecting a POW item while in human form will restore the player's energy. If a POW is collected while wearing the suit, however, the player's energy will NOT be increased but their weapon will receive a power-up.

The game's platforms are littered with springboards that fire the player high into the air when stepped on. Some platforms - often containing POW items - can only be reached via a springboard."

";"The third game in Namco's classic ""Galaxian"" series, Gaplus picks up where 1981's ""Galaga"" left off. While maintaining the same classic 'look' of its predecessor, Gaplus's graphics are a definite improvement over those of ""Galaga""; the game's increased color palette and subtle use of shading making the attacking aliens look rather more solid.

Another enhancement over its prequel is in the addition of a player-acquired 'Tractor Beam'. In ""Galaga"", only the enemies had access to the beam; enabling them to capture one of the player's 'Fighter' ships (the player then had to shoot the captor to release the Fighter). For the sequel, however, the player can now acquire the Tractor Beam. This is achieved by shooting one of the alien formation's 'generals' - a visibly more colourful alien than its comrades. The Tractor Beam will then activate for a limited time and any aliens the players captures (up to a maximum of six) will dock alongside the player's ship for enhanced firepower.

One final yet important addition is in the movement of the player's ship. In previous installments, the ship could only move left and right along the bottom of the screen; in Gaplus, however, the ship can now move UP the screen - although only to the halfway point. This is important as the alien's aggressive attack patterns will often see enemy craft swirling around the bottom of the play area.

As with ""Galaga"", Gaplus features regular 'Challenging Stages', with benign aliens swooping across the screen for the player to shoot as many times as possible, in order to try and spell out a word and earn extra bonus points."

";"Gauntlet II is a direct sequel to the legendary maze-based fantasy themed shoot-em-up, released a year earlier. Atari chose not to tinker with the core game-play mechanic to any great degree, opting instead to enhance the already excellent multi-player action that had created such a stir upon the original game's release.

As with its prequel, up to four players once again take on the role of either 'Thor the Warrior', 'Thyra the Valkyrie', 'Merlin the Wizard', or 'Questor the Elf' and must play cooperatively as they explore and fight their way through the enemy-packed mazes, collecting potions, food and treasure as they searched for the exit that would lead them to the next dungeon.

Changes to the sequel included the ability for players to play whatever character they wanted, even if that character was already in play. Characters were now colour-coded and players would find themselves taking on the role of 'Blue Elf', 'Green Wizard', etc. New in-game speech was added to allow for the new player definitions.

Other changes included the ability to 'bounce' shots off walls - known as 'Reflective Shots' - providing the correct potion was picked up. As well as new potions, Gauntlet II also featured several new monsters. The most notorious of the new additions was the Fire-breathing Dragon that guards the exit to some dungeons. This powerful creature takes multiple hits to kill and defeating it would see the players rewarded with a permanent potion and a bag of treasure.

Another notable addition was the 'It' monster: any player who was tagged by the creature would suddenly find that all of that level's monsters would ONLY chase the tagged player, completely ignoring the presence of all other players. The only way to remove this curse was to tag another player, thus making them 'it'.

New level elements were also added to further increase variety. These included dungeons with entirely invisible walls, magical walls (which changed into monsters or items when hit), stun tiles (which stunned any player that walked on them) and exits that flashed between functioning and non-functioning."

";"Gauntlet is a maze-based shoot-em-up for up to four players. Heavily influenced by classic fantasy conventions, players take on the role of either Thor the Warrior, Thyra the Valkyrie, Merlin the Wizard, or Questor the Elf and must play cooperatively as they explore and fight their way through the enemy-packed mazes. Competitive play is encouraged as players must fight for the limited amount of food, treasure, magic potions and power-up items that litter the dungeons. 

Each of Gauntlet's four characters have different strengths and weaknesses: Thyra has the strongest armour, Thor is best at hand-to-hand combat, Questor has the fastest speed and Merlin has the most powerful magic attacks. The object of the game is simply to survive as long as possible while exploring Gauntlet's mazes in search of treasure, food, magic potions and, ultimately, the exit that leads to the next dungeon. 

The potions - shown as blue bottles - that litter the levels offer either improved character abilities (such as 'speed' or 'extra shot power') or can be used as a 'smart bomb', destroying some or all of the on-screen monsters. Potions are also the only way to kill the game's 'Death' character that appears in many of the stages. Magic potions can be kept and used at the player's discretion by pressing 'Magic' button, although each potion can only be used once. 

The first seven mazes are always the same, but from level 8 onwards, players will find themselves on any one of over a hundred different mazes. If players survive for long enough, the mazes will be repeated in a different order. How long a player lasts depends upon the player's 'health' level. Health continually depletes as time progresses and further health is lost by contact with various monsters or their projectiles. Health can be replenished by consuming the food found in the mazes or by inserting more credits. The many treasure chests that litter the levels can be plundered for points, and collecting treasure increases a player's score multiplier when two or more players are playing the game."

The potions - shown as blue bottles - that litter the levels offer either improved character abilities (such as 'speed' or 'extra shot power') or can be used as a 'smart bomb', destroying some or all of the on-screen monsters. Potions are also the only way to kill the game's 'Death' character that appears in many of the stages. Magic potions can be kept and used at the player's discretion by pressing 'Magic' button, although each potion can only be used once. 

The first seven mazes are always the same, but from level 8 onwards, players will find themselves on any one of over a hundred different mazes. If players survive for long enough, the mazes will be repeated in a different order. How long a player lasts depends upon the player's 'health' level. Health continually depletes as time progresses and further health is lost by contact with various monsters or their projectiles. Health can be replenished by consuming the food found in the mazes or by inserting more credits. The many treasure chests that litter the levels can be plundered for points, and collecting treasure increases a player's score multiplier when two or more players are playing the game."

";"Green Beret is a sideways-scrolling action/platform game set during the Cold War, in which a US Special Forces Marine must infiltrate a Russian military base to save four POW's from being executed by firing squad. 

Initially, the soldier is armed with only a combat knife, but by killing the certain enemy troops, players can obtain either a three-shot flamethrower, a four-shot RPG, or a three-pack of hand grenades. 

The Marine can jump or lie down to avoid the enemy bullets, as well as climbing ladders to avoid enemies and projectiles, as well as the flashing land mines that litter the levels. While it's possible to remain still in one area to rack up points, if players take too long to proceed, the game will start sending out tougher enemies and eventually a stealth-like bomber will appear to take out the player. There is also an unseen time limit that will kill off players if they take too long to complete the stage. 

The game has four stages in total: a missile base, a harbour, an air Base and a Siberian POW Camp. At the end of each stage the Marine will face a group of enemies specific to that stage: Stage 1 ends with a truckload of running and jump-kicking soldiers, Stage 2 with a pack of fierce dogs and their handlers, Stage 3 with three Gyro-copters and Stage 4 with a number of multi-shot flamethrower operators. 

The game is completed once the captives have been rescued at the end of the fourth stage, after which the action starts over with an increased level of difficulty."

G-Darius' game-play was also enhanced, with the 'Capture Ball' system; this allowed the player to capture almost any enemy craft and use it against the game's other enemies. Captured enemies can either be detonated like a ''bomb'', damaging all enemies nearby; or used to fire a special 'Alpha Beam', which cuts through everything but gold-colored objects and enemy bosses. Each boss is capable of firing its own version of this beam at the player; when both beams meet, they will interrupt each other's path. Depending on how rapidly the player presses the Fire button, one beam will grow and eventually overpower the others. The Capture ball was actually introduced in ""Darius Gaiden"" but was only used to a minimal extent."

";"Genpei Touma Den is a multi-genre birds-eye view action, 2D side-scroller beat 'em up, and 2D side-scroller platform arcade game that was released by Namco in 1986 only in Japan. 

The character controlled by the player is that of a real Japanese samurai, Taira no Kagekiyo, who fell at the Battle of Dan-no-ura at the end of the Genpei War in 1185. Over eight hundred years later he is resurrected and has to make his way over the Imperial Regalia of Japan - fighting other characters who actually existed such as Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Saito Musashibo Benkei on his travels, as well as collecting the three sacred game items and defeating his arch-enemy Minamoto no Yoritomo.

This game has three types of stages: Small Mode (standard), Big Mode (with large characters, and usually boss fights), and Overhead Mode (like Small Mode, but as the name suggests, viewed from an overhead perspective). Most stages have torii (a gate) at the end of them, which are used to transport the player to a different stage. Most of the Small Mode and Overhead Mode stages have multiple torii at the end of them, which lead to different places on the map of the Imperial Regalia. Big Mode stages, however, only have one torii at the end of them. If Kagekiyo is unlucky enough to fall into a pit in any of the Small Mode stages, he will end up in a non-standard Overhead Mode stage known as the ""Pit Stage"" (from which there are only two ways to escape - and one of these two does not always work).

The game also features the Sanzu River, the place believed in Japanese Buddhism to separate ""the current life"" and ""the afterlife"", resembling the concept of the Underworld or Hell. Therefore, mythological characters such as Emma-O, God of the Underworld, and Sun Goddess Amaterasu, appear in this game (the former in the aforementioned ""Pit Stage"" and the latter in a non-standard Small Mode stage called the ""Bonus Stage"")."

1501;goldnaxa;goldnaxe;"Golden Axe (c) 1989 Sega.
";"Golden Axe is a sideways scrolling beat-em-up set in a traditional fantasy world, in which up to three warriors take up arms to rescue the kidnapped King and his Queen from the evil Death Adder.

The game's three different playable characters are an Amazonian warrior named Tyris Flare, a Barbarian hero named Ax Battler, and a Viking dwarf named Gilius Thunderhead. Each character has a special attack move that is activated by pressing both JUMP and ATTACK at the same time. Also, double-tapping the joystick right or left will make the character charge and smash into opponents.

At certain points during the game, players will come across enemies riding creatures (such as dragons). If the player knocks the original rider from the saddle, the created can be mounted and used against the enemy.

At certain points during a level, as well as on the between-stage intermittent levels, Thieves appear carrying a sack on their back. Players can hit the Thieves causing them to drop food and magic potions - the latter of which are used to create a special magical attack that damages or kills all on-screen enemies.

Each of the game's heroes uses a different kind of magic: Ax Battler uses Earth magic, Tyris uses fire magic and Gilius uses lightning magic. In addition: each player character also carries a different weapon: Tyris and Ax Battler both use swords while Gilius wields an axe.

Golden Axe consists of 9 levels, although only 5 of these are true levels as every 2nd stage is a short intermittent level featuring only the sack-carrying Goblins.

Once Golden Axe has been beaten, an end sequence is a scene of a video arcade, in which the game's characters jump out of the arcade cabinet and chase the game's players out of the arcade and down the street."

1506;golgo13;golgo13;"Golgo 13 (c) 1999 Namco.
";"A lightgun game in which the player, armed with a semi-automatic sniper rifle takes on the role of the world's most lethal and highly paid assassin, Duke Togo: Codename Golgo 13. Unlike other lightgun games Golgo 13 is very story driven and combines both 3-D and 2-D graphic elements.

The player starts their career with a 100 percent accuracy rating and takes on various assignments. Each assignment begins with a 2D comic book storyline and although in Japanese they should still give the player some idea of the background story. The objective of the chosen assignment is then displayed together with the time limit, target zone, and available ammunition.

At the end of each assignment the player is treated to on screen display of their performance. For each assignment successfully completed a large sum of cash is added to the player’s total, plus an extra sum is awarded for hitting the target zone. If however the player fails to complete the objective or the timer reaches zero, the player’s accuracy rating is reduced and the player is then moved on to choose the next assignment. The game is over when the player’s accuracy rating reaches zero.

At the start of the player’s career, 5 different assignments are available to choose from and can be completed in any order. Once all 5 assignments have been undertaken a new round of assignments becomes available. In total there are 4 rounds each consisting of 5 assignments, with each round becoming progressively harder. The last round includes a special stage which can only be selected after all the assignments have been completed. Upon completion of the special stage the credits roll and the game ends. The player is then once again returned to the start of the game."

1511;gorf;gorf;"Gorf (c) 1981 Midway.
";"The player's goal is to defeat the Gorfian Empire and safeguard the future of mankind. Gorf is a single screen shoot-em-up in the classic ""Space Invaders"" mould, the prime difference being that Gorf offers five distinct levels of shooting action. The levels are as follows : 

* Mission 1 - Astro Battles : The first mission is more or less a straight clone of ""Space Invaders"", set against a sky-blue background. The player is protected by a glittering parabolic forcefield, which is gradually worn away by enemy projectiles. The forcefield also works in BOTH directions, and therefore must momentarily deactivate in order for the player's ship to fire out. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the invaders. 

* Mission 2 - Laser Attack : The other missions are all set in space. In this mission, the player is faced with two formations each made up of five enemies. The formations are cross-shaped, and at the bottom of each formation is a single laser gun. The laser guns fire a long, dangerous yellow beam at regular intervals. At the same time, the other enemies may break formation and attempt to divebomb the player. Destroying a laser gun causes the corresponding formation to break apart. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the enemies. 

* Mission 3 - Galaxians : This mission is a clone of ""Galaxian"". The player is faced with a swarm of galaxians, which continually divebomb and shower the player with deadly projectiles. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the galaxians. 

* Mission 4 - Space Warp : A wormhole is situated in the middle of the screen out of which enemies ships emerge, one at a time, and spiral outward at increasing speed; whilst growing larger and flinging fireballs at the player. The Space Warp level would have an influence on Konami's superb ""Gyruss"", released two years later. To advance to the next mission, the player must survive a number of these enemies. 

* Mission 5, Flag Ship : The final mission is a one-on-one confrontation with the alien Flag Ship itself. The Flag Ship is one of the earliest examples of the 'boss' enemy in mainstream video games. It is equipped with its own forcefield, through which the player must blast in order to get a clean shot on the ship. It is also armed with a powerful fireball weapon. The player's weapon has a minor effect on the Flag Ship's hull, and can only blast off tiny pieces of it. This adds to the player's problems, as stray pieces of hull can destroy their ship. These pieces can be destroyed with a single shot. The only way to destroy the Flag Ship is to hit the glowing reactor at the heart of the ship, either by first blasting away the hull to expose it, or by managing to fire a shot directly into the tiny vent that leads to the reactor. 

Each time the Flag Ship is destroyed, the player advances in rank. Initially, the player begins with the rank of Space Cadet, before moving on to Space Captain, Space Colonel, Space General, Space Warrior, and finally Space Avenger. The player's spaceship is equipped with a Quark Laser which allows the player to cancel a poorly aimed shot and fire another shot."

Gorkans must also watch out for the orange flames (which are palette-swapped versions of him) and also moving along the blue lines and burning them away - because if he ends up touching one of them (or unable to move given that he cannot retrace his steps), he will lose a life. If you are running out of space to go it is also possible to wait in one of the corners for the orange flames to burn themselves out. It is also possible to cut the orange flames off completely from Gorkans  and force them to move along particular lines by clearing out all the lines around the walls and leaving them with no option.

Gradius' eye-catching graphics guaranteed gamer interest but it was the game's genius 'weapon upgrade' system that really made the difference. Never before could players actually CHOSE how to upgrade their ship. Destroying waves of enemies would often see the player reward with an 'orb' that could be picked up. The player could collect up to 6 orbs and could effectively 'buy' an upgrade from the 6 displayed at the bottom of the play area (speed-up, bombs, double, laser, multiple - which are orbs that follow the player's movements and add greater firepower - and a mystery 6th upgrade that is marked with an '?').

";"Gravitar is a 1- or 2-player game with a color X-Y video display. This new display, with its three color guns and higher voltage, has the same technology that was used in previous Atari black-and-white X-Y displays. However, the screen now displays dazzling colors and unique visual effects. 

The player controls a space ship in three different solar systems. Each solar system consists of a home base, a death star, a red alien planet and four regular planets. Each planet has its own unique terrain. 

The red alien planet is the home of shooting alien ships. Some of the regular planets may have flying alien rammers to be avoided or shot down. The four planets all have fuel cells to be retrieved with a tractor beam and alien bunkers that fire shells. Successfully destroying all of the bunkers results in a MISSION COMPLETE message at the top of the screen. Achieving MISSION COMPLETE allows the player to collect bonus if he can evade the rammers when leaving the planet. If successful, he will be placed back in the solar system. 

A player has two ways to advance to the next solar system. The first is to successfully complete a mission on all four regular planets. The second way is to complete a mission on the red alien planet, which establishes a link into the next solar system. 

The play mode begins in the first solar system with the player's blue ship in the center of the screen at home base. There are four regular planets plus a fifth red alien planet and a death star arranged clockwise around the screen in increasing order of difficulty. The planets are worth 2,000, 4,000, 6,000, and 8,000 points with a value of 9,000 points on the alien planet. The positions of the alien planet and the death star vary in the second and third solar systems. After the first solar system all planets are valued at 9,000 points. The death star, located near home base, is the center of gravity in each solar system. Colliding with it results in the loss of one life, and the player returns to home base. 

The words SCORE (with current total score), FUEL (running total of original 10,000-point fuel supply), and BONUS (decreasing point value of planet under attack) appear at the top of the screen throughout game play. 

Player controls consist of LEFT ROTATE, RIGHT ROTATE, FIRE, THRUST, and TRACTOR/SHIELD yellow pushbuttons. Use FIRE to shoot targets. A player has four shells that must hit a target or must travel their full distance in order to be reloaded. TRACTOR/SHIELD retrieves fuel with a tractor beam and shields the ship from alien shots. The TRACTOR/SHIELD does not prevent the ship from crashing into land or alien ships. TRACTOR/SHIELD and THRUST decrease the player's fuel supply. Using these controls together decreases the fuel supply even faster. 

Blue fuel cells are positioned just below a planet's surface. There are two, three, or four fuel cells per planet terrain (depending on level of game play). Each cell beamed aboard ship with TRACTOR is worth 2,500 fuel units. 

If the player's ship is above the highest point on some planet terrains, flying alien rammers attack him. Shooting a rammer scores 100 points. 

If the player gets too close to a shooting alien ship, he is involved in a one-on-one space dogfight, and either he or the alien ship must die. If the player is victorious, he returns to the solar system at his original spot; if the alien ship wins, the player loses a life and returns to home base. 

Red alien bunkers appear on each planet. There are 2, 4, 6, or 8 bunkers per surface (depending on the difficulty of the planet). The bunkers fire shots to protect the fuel cells. Exploding a bunker scores 250 points. Exploding all bunkers in a solar system displays a MISSION COMPLETE message. 

The word SUPERBONUS and the number of superbonus points appear in the middle of the screen only after a completed mission on the first planet in the first solar system. These superbonus points are awarded on the basis of initial difficulty of the first planet successfully completed. The higher the bonus point value of the planet attacked, the higher the superbonus awarded. No superbonus points are awarded for attacking the 2,000-point (easiest) planet or for attacking the four regular planets in consecutive order of difficulty. 

A player may fly to any planet he chooses. The number beside each planet is the starting number of bonus points for that planet. Entering a planet causes the distinct planet terrain to appear. To get maximum points, the player must shoot all alien bunkers and see MISSION COMPLETE at the top of the screen. A player may exit a planet at any time; he does not have to stay any longer than he wishes. 

The red alien planet (worth 9,000 points) is home for red alien ships that must be shot down or avoided. The alien planet looks the same in every solar system: terrain consists of a spiral tunnel with a reactor at its end. Under a decrementing timer, the player must maneuver through the tunnel without hitting the walls and shoot the reactor (Hitting the walls or not escaping in time places the player back at home base). Shooting the reactor will make it glow and pulsate. Then the player must escape before the timer reaches zero (In the next solar systems, the timer of the alien planet decreases by two seconds, and there are shooting bunkers to overcome). Completing the mission on the alien planet places the player in the next solar system with an additional 7,500 fuel points. 

Gravitar progresses by waves of planets (new solar systems). Successfully destroying the reactor and escaping from the red alien planet, or achieving a MISSION COMPLETE on all four regular planets places the player in the next solar system (next level of game play). The 4 levels of game play are described as follows : 

a. Regular gravity 
b. Negative gravity 
c. Regular gravity with invisible landscape and maximum difficulty 
d. Negative gravity with invisible landscape and maximum difficulty 

Alien ship speed and firing frequency, rammer speed, bunker firing frequency, and bonus points are all based on time elapsed in game play. Both regular and negative gravity increase, depending on the initial planet bonus level. 

The game ends when all lives are used up or when player is out of fuel."

Then the player must escape before the timer reaches zero (In the next solar systems, the timer of the alien planet decreases by two seconds, and there are shooting bunkers to overcome). Completing the mission on the alien planet places the player in the next solar system with an additional 7,500 fuel points. 

Gravitar progresses by waves of planets (new solar systems). Successfully destroying the reactor and escaping from the red alien planet, or achieving a MISSION COMPLETE on all four regular planets places the player in the next solar system (next level of game play). The 4 levels of game play are described as follows : 

a. Regular gravity 
b. Negative gravity 
c. Regular gravity with invisible landscape and maximum difficulty 
d. Negative gravity with invisible landscape and maximum difficulty 

Alien ship speed and firing frequency, rammer speed, bunker firing frequency, and bonus points are all based on time elapsed in game play. Both regular and negative gravity increase, depending on the initial planet bonus level. 

The game ends when all lives are used up or when player is out of fuel."
1525;gravp;gravitar1;"Gravitar (c) 1982 Atari.
";"Gravitar is a 1- or 2-player game with a color X-Y video display. This new display, with its three color guns and higher voltage, has the same technology that was used in previous Atari black-and-white X-Y displays. However, the screen now displays dazzling colors and unique visual effects. 

The player controls a space ship in three different solar systems. Each solar system consists of a home base, a death star, a red alien planet and four regular planets. Each planet has its own unique terrain. 

The red alien planet is the home of shooting alien ships. Some of the regular planets may have flying alien rammers to be avoided or shot down. The four planets all have fuel cells to be retrieved with a tractor beam and alien bunkers that fire shells. Successfully destroying all of the bunkers results in a MISSION COMPLETE message at the top of the screen. Achieving MISSION COMPLETE allows the player to collect bonus if he can evade the rammers when leaving the planet. If successful, he will be placed back in the solar system. 

A player has two ways to advance to the next solar system. The first is to successfully complete a mission on all four regular planets. The second way is to complete a mission on the red alien planet, which establishes a link into the next solar system. 

The play mode begins in the first solar system with the player's blue ship in the center of the screen at home base. There are four regular planets plus a fifth red alien planet and a death star arranged clockwise around the screen in increasing order of difficulty. The planets are worth 2,000, 4,000, 6,000, and 8,000 points with a value of 9,000 points on the alien planet. The positions of the alien planet and the death star vary in the second and third solar systems. After the first solar system all planets are valued at 9,000 points. The death star, located near home base, is the center of gravity in each solar system. Colliding with it results in the loss of one life, and the player returns to home base. 

The words SCORE (with current total score), FUEL (running total of original 10,000-point fuel supply), and BONUS (decreasing point value of planet under attack) appear at the top of the screen throughout game play. 

Player controls consist of LEFT ROTATE, RIGHT ROTATE, FIRE, THRUST, and TRACTOR/SHIELD yellow pushbuttons. Use FIRE to shoot targets. A player has four shells that must hit a target or must travel their full distance in order to be reloaded. TRACTOR/SHIELD retrieves fuel with a tractor beam and shields the ship from alien shots. The TRACTOR/SHIELD does not prevent the ship from crashing into land or alien ships. TRACTOR/SHIELD and THRUST decrease the player's fuel supply. Using these controls together decreases the fuel supply even faster. 

Blue fuel cells are positioned just below a planet's surface. There are two, three, or four fuel cells per planet terrain (depending on level of game play). Each cell beamed aboard ship with TRACTOR is worth 2,500 fuel units. 

If the player's ship is above the highest point on some planet terrains, flying alien rammers attack him. Shooting a rammer scores 100 points. 

If the player gets too close to a shooting alien ship, he is involved in a one-on-one space dogfight, and either he or the alien ship must die. If the player is victorious, he returns to the solar system at his original spot; if the alien ship wins, the player loses a life and returns to home base. 

Red alien bunkers appear on each planet. There are 2, 4, 6, or 8 bunkers per surface (depending on the difficulty of the planet). The bunkers fire shots to protect the fuel cells. Exploding a bunker scores 250 points. Exploding all bunkers in a solar system displays a MISSION COMPLETE message. 

The word SUPERBONUS and the number of superbonus points appear in the middle of the screen only after a completed mission on the first planet in the first solar system. These superbonus points are awarded on the basis of initial difficulty of the first planet successfully completed. The higher the bonus point value of the planet attacked, the higher the superbonus awarded. No superbonus points are awarded for attacking the 2,000-point (easiest) planet or for attacking the four regular planets in consecutive order of difficulty. 

A player may fly to any planet he chooses. The number beside each planet is the starting number of bonus points for that planet. Entering a planet causes the distinct planet terrain to appear. To get maximum points, the player must shoot all alien bunkers and see MISSION COMPLETE at the top of the screen. A player may exit a planet at any time; he does not have to stay any longer than he wishes. 

The red alien planet (worth 9,000 points) is home for red alien ships that must be shot down or avoided. The alien planet looks the same in every solar system: terrain consists of a spiral tunnel with a reactor at its end. Under a decrementing timer, the player must maneuver through the tunnel without hitting the walls and shoot the reactor (Hitting the walls or not escaping in time places the player back at home base). Shooting the reactor will make it glow and pulsate. Then the player must escape before the timer reaches zero (In the next solar systems, the timer of the alien planet decreases by two seconds, and there are shooting bunkers to overcome). Completing the mission on the alien planet places the player in the next solar system with an additional 7,500 fuel points. 

Gravitar progresses by waves of planets (new solar systems). Successfully destroying the reactor and escaping from the red alien planet, or achieving a MISSION COMPLETE on all four regular planets places the player in the next solar system (next level of game play). The 4 levels of game play are described as follows :

";"A game where the player controls a bottle-shaped character named Gridlee who has to catch colored balls (or the crystal) for points & shoot the enemies while they are overhead. Shooting enemies also awards the player points, but more importantly, the only way to pass a level is to shoot every enemy. The player knows when the enemy is overhead by looking at his shadow on the grid. Each red ball is worth 100 points. The green ball appears after catching 3 red balls & isworth 500 points. The crystal appears after catching 3 red balls, a green ball and 3 more red balls. It is worth 1000 points and must be caught before it lands since it will not bounce, but instead disappear. The green balls bounce very high and can bounce far, making them hard to catch. The player has to avoid touching the bouncing enemies, the charged tiles that flash after enemies land on them, and the worm that moves horizontally across the tiles while charging them. There is a character named Igor that spits a sticky gum-like substance, which turns the tile it lands on pink and causes Gridlee to move slow when walking on that tile. Also, if there's one enemy left bouncing for a while as the player catches the
balls, the enemy eventually charges tile after tile, which makes it dangerous for the player as the walking space is limited."

";"In 2631, a meteorite strikes the Galuga archipelago near New Zealand, carrying with it a dormant alien lifeform. Two years later in 2633, a terrorist organization of alien origin called Red Falcon takes over the island as part of their plot to invade the Earth. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat.

Gryzor is a hectic 1 or 2-player platform shoot-em-up featuring five stages. Three of the levels are standard side-scrolling platform levels, while the remaining 2 are enemy 'bases'; 3rd person into-the-screen stages in which players must run down series of heavily defended corridors to reach and destroy an end-of-level boss, before moving onto the next stage.

Each player's character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character's movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player's character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player's inventory.

As players fight their way through the enemy-packed levels, additional weapons can be collected. If the player loses a life, they will also lose any weapon power-up they were carrying. Available weapons are :
* Machine gun [M] : Auto-fire.
* Spread gun [S] : Allows the player to fire five shots in an arc.
* Laser gun [L] : Will shoot a long laser that can take out many enemies in a row.
* Fire Ball [F] : A gun which fires small fireballs in a corkscrew pattern.
* Rapid-fire [R] : Increases the firing rate of the player's currently equipped weapon.
* Barrier [B] : Will make the player invincible for a few seconds.

The game's 5 levels and bosses are as follows :
Stage 1 : Jungle – Defensive Wall – (horizontal scrolling)
Stage 2 : Base 01 – Six turrets and alien eyeball – (3rd-person)
Stage 3 : Waterfall – Large Alien – (vertical scrolling)

";"Gumbo is a ""Columns""-style adult puzzle game featuring nude photographic and hand drawn images as a background to the playing field.  Columns of three blocks fall from the sky and the player can move the block left or right and shift the order of the blocks column falls. The objective is to match three or more blocks of the same type in vertical, horizontal, or diagonal rows in order to clear them from the play area. As the player clears more blocks the columns begin to descend at a more rapid rate.

As time progresses entire rows of blocks are added to the bottom of the play area. Occasionally after clearing a set of blocks (and more often after setting off chains of removing blocks) the bottom row of blocks will be removed from the play area. If necessary, the player can use a help which will change all of the blocks in the currently falling column into 'P' blocks. When the column lands on the stack of blocks, whichever block it falls on will be cleared from the screen, along with all blocks that match that block.  When the bottom row is removed from play a section is added to the progress bar at the bottom of the screen. When the progress bar is filled the stage is complete.

After clearing a stage, all of the remaining blocks are momentarily removed from the board and a bonus game begins.  In the bonus game the background image is broken up and shuffled around in a sliding puzzle game.  The progress bar at the bottom of the screen counts down the time left to return the tiles to their proper place and points are awarded for any extra time left after the game is completed.  Once the bonus game is over the background image is changed, the blocks remaining from the previous stage are returned to the screen and the game continues.

If the blocks reach the top of the screen where the columns are dropped from then the game is over.  Upon continuing all of the blocks are removed from play and the columns fall at the original speed."

";"The year is 2120: Earthlings have spread beyond their galaxy and have started to colonize uninhabited planets in different solar systems. One such planet to be colonized was the Earth-like planet Gloria which happened to have an enormous natural supply of gold. This discovery became pivotal to Gloria's emigration, so much that emigrators would be impoverished by the cost of reaching the planet. Because of this, life on the planet thrived in a setting similar to the American Old West. Though poor, the gold trade aided the Glorian's in advancing technology and knowledge, so much that among the inhabitants lived talented inventors and engineers.

However, the Glorian's were not the only ones who were tempted by the planet's gold: Space pirates known as the Wild Lizards quickly invade Gloria and decimate the towns of the people and enslave those who survived in an attempt to deplete the planet's gold supply. Two inventors of Gloria who were a part of the planet's development teams decide to strike back at their invaders using two fighter jets in the shape of giant revolvers with plane wings.

As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, Gun Frontier is very standard. Players start with dual machine guns which are strengthened and multiplied by upgrades that come in the shape of US dimes taken from buffalo shaped enemies and every five dimes empowers the ship's guns. Players also start with a bomb supply which is upgraded to further destruction by collecting gold bars from destroyed ground forces. Once a player accumulates 25 bombs, they are granted access to the Bomber Max, the strongest of the player's bombs.

The players can also pick up spinning coins with two different sides: a silver side and a gold side. If the player collects the coin on the silver side, then the player merely gains another coin for their guns. However, if the player collects the coin on the gold side, then the player's guns and bomb supply is maximized to full power.

A unique feature to the player's bombs is that the direction of the bomb's blast can be determined by the player's movement. If the player moves their plane to the lower right of the screen and launches their bombs, then the direction the bomb will travel in the opposite direction the plane's movement. This feature can only be used however when a player has a large bomb count as only having one or two bombs will result in a small directionless explosion. Like most bombs in shoot 'em ups, the bombs also work as a shield against enemy fire.

The game uses a check-point system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the check-point they died at.

Gun Frontier also employs an anti-autofire mechanism where the difficulty will max out by the second stage if the player is sustaining too fast of a fire rate."

";"Gyruss is a single-player shoot-em-up in which the purpose is to fly through the solar system, destroying waves of alien attackers, before finally reaching Earth. Planets that must be passed before Earth is reached are Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. 

It only takes two warps to reach Neptune, but all of the others, including Earth, take three warps to get to. Each time the player reaches a planet, they will be faced with a 'Chance Stage', a bonus stage in which players try to destroy as many aliens as possible to accrue points. After reaching Earth, there is a Chance Stage, followed by a very fast '3 Warps to Neptune' stage. After this, the levels and the background music start over. 

Gyruss' superb gameplay, in which the player ship rotates around the edges of the screen and fires 'inwards', is heavily influenced by Atari's 1981 classic, ""Tempest"". While the design of the alien ships themselves is similar to those of Namco's also-legendary ""Galaga"" series."

Hard Drivin' might look like an arcade game but it drives like a real car. For the best lap times, drive Hard Drivin' as if it were a real car. The main difference between Hard Drivin' and a real car is that Hard Drivin' is much safer to drive. A player can test the limits of the car and his skill with no risk of personal injury, and follow a course that does not exist anywhere in the real world.

After inserting the proper number of coins to start the simulator, the player can select either an automatic or manual transmission. Turning the ignition key starts the simulator.

Drivers can choose between the stunt track or the speed track by following the posted signs on the road. Each player has a certain (operator-selectable) amount of time to reach a checkpoint or the finish line. Crossing checkpoints and the finish line rewards the player with (operator-selectable) bonus driving time.

With Hard Drivin' a player can test drive a high-powered sports car on a real stunt course. He can jump a draw bridge, negotiate a high-speed banked turn and drive a 360-degree vertical loop. These thrilling stunts, among others, provide the ultimate realistic driving experience.

Or maybe high-speed driving is a particular player's type of excitement. He can 'put the pedal to the metal' and try to keep control around the corners, weaving in and out of traffic while avoiding oncoming cars. All this, and more, await the player behind the wheel of Hard Drivin'.

Players especially enjoy the unique instant replay feature on Hard Drivin'.  Every time a player crashes, the simulator records and replays the crash sequence. Not only will the player find this entertaining, but it is also informative. The instant replay shows the player exactly what he did wrong and why he crashed (If a player wants to skip the instant replay, he can press the abort switch or turn the key when the replay starts).

A skilled player finds the ultimate competition in the 'challenge' lap (or 'grudge match' as Atari Games likes to call it).

It’s the ride of your life. You feel the tires grip the road when you take a wide turn at high speed. You're alerted to the smallest change in the road by the feedback steering. You catch air as you fly the draw bridge and land on the down ramp. You control the car as it holds the road on the dizzying vertical loop.

Hard Drivin' might look like an arcade game but it drives like a real car. For the best lap times, drive Hard Drivin' as if it were a real car. The main difference between Hard Drivin' and a real car is that Hard Drivin' is much safer to drive. A player can test the limits of the car and his skill with no risk of personal injury, and follow a course that does not exist anywhere in the real world.

After inserting the proper number of coins to start the simulator, the player can select either an automatic or manual transmission. Turning the ignition key starts the simulator.

Drivers can choose between the stunt track or the speed track by following the posted signs on the road. Each player has a certain (operator-selectable) amount of time to reach a checkpoint or the finish line. Crossing checkpoints and the finish line rewards the player with (operator-selectable) bonus driving time.

With Hard Drivin' a player can test drive a high-powered sports car on a real stunt course. He can jump a draw bridge, negotiate a high-speed banked turn and drive a 360-degree vertical loop. These thrilling stunts, among others, provide the ultimate realistic driving experience.

Or maybe high-speed driving is a particular player's type of excitement. He can 'put the pedal to the metal' and try to keep control around the corners, weaving in and out of traffic while avoiding oncoming cars. All this, and more, await the player behind the wheel of Hard Drivin'.

Players especially enjoy the unique instant replay feature on Hard Drivin'.  Every time a player crashes, the simulator records and replays the crash sequence. Not only will the player find this entertaining, but it is also informative. The instant replay shows the player exactly what he did wrong and why he crashed (If a player wants to skip the instant replay, he can press the abort switch or turn the key when the replay starts).

A skilled player finds the ultimate competition in the 'challenge' lap (or 'grudge match' as Atari Games likes to call it). The simulator remembers the path of the car driven by the best driver on record.  When a player beats the qualifying lap time, he challenges the car of the past winner in a head-to-head race."

";"Heavy Barrel is a scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players, in which an army of terrorists have seized control of a nuclear missile facility. Players must infiltrate the heavily defended base and shoot their way through seven levels before reaching the final enemy Boss confrontation.

As with SNK's ""Ikari"" series, Heavy Barrel allows players to rotate their on-screen character and fire and move in all directions. Additional weapons and power-ups can be found, as well as keys which are used to open locked weapon containers that litter the levels.

In addition to the standard in-game weapons, the ""Heavy Barrel"" gun of the game's title also features. This must be assembled by collecting six different components (found in locked weapon containers). Once completed, the Heavy Barrel gives the player incredible firepower and instantly destroys anything it hits (with the exception of end-of-level bosses, which take several hits), although the Heavy Barrel only lasts for a period of thirty seconds, as indicated by a depleting red bar displayed at the top of the screen."

There is also Nyamco, a cat who patrols in a zigzag pattern, but he needs to take occasional breaks. There are eight treasures that a player must grab to complete a round, except on the bonus round where the player will just want to collect all the balloons that he can. The main intrigue here is getting past a blockade of Meowkies. 

The player controls are simple - Mappy can bounce in any of the four directions, the only places he can land are the centres of the checkerboard squares (making for very few locations overall), and he will move at the same speed as the cats. If the player pushes the accelerator button and runs around, he will go twice as fast. When the cats have sped up (after a ""Hurry Up"" warning has appeared) they will match Mappy's accelerated speed."

There are several kinds of enemy robots that guard some of the boxes; they all move in preset patterns and you will have to learn their movements in order to figure out the best moment to sneak past them. If any of them touch Hopper Robo he will die. He must also avoid other obstacles such as flying hammers and springs. To aid Hopper Robo, there are springboards to reach higher platforms, and pipes to slide back down. If Hopper Robo should run out of energy, it will cost him a life - but when he clears a round, his remaining energy will be awarded to the player, as bonus points. There are eight unique levels, after which the game loops indefinitely."

";"Hot-Rod is a scrolling top-down racing game in which up to four players race each other over a variety of different surfaces on a selection of narrow, twisting roads. Each player's vehicle has a fuel (gas) meter that constantly depletes as the race progresses. Extra fuel and bonus pick-ups are placed at regular intervals on each track and can be collected by driving over them. If a car runs out of fuel it is automatically disqualified from the race. 

During races the track scrolls to follow the current race leader. If the last-placed driver falls too far behind the leader and allows the scrolling area to catch up with them, their car is automatically transported further up the track, resulting in a fuel penalty.

There are always four cars competing in each race, with computer-controlled cars replacing any positions not filled by human players. Any driver finishing in the Top three is awarded bonus points, with the amount determined on whether they finish 1st, 2nd or 3rd. These points can be used to buy car upgrades in the garage shop that appears at the end of every race. The upgrades available are; engine, tyre, wing and bumper. These affect speed, handling and durability. Particular attention should be paid to tyre choice, as different tyres are suited to specific race surfaces, with the next stage's surface being visible as the car enters the garage. Players can equip either a front or rear engine but not both at once. It is also impossible to have a spoiler and a rear engine equipped simultaneously.

There are a total of 30 different tracks set across ten different environments, including busy highways, dirt roads, a beach-side course, a mountain course, farmlands, snowy terrain, a desert, a construction zone, a shipyard and city streets. There are three races per environment with every third race ending with a victory ceremony in a stadium, before play moves on to the next environment."

";"Hunchback is a classic and much-copied platform game in which the player takes on the role of the eponymous bell-ringer, Quasimodo, in his quest to rescue the beautiful Esmeralda from the tower of the castle fortress.

To reach Esmeralda, Quasi must run and jump through a number of screens - each representing part of a castle wall - to reach the tower and complete his rescue. Each screen presents the player with a different set of platform-based obstacles. These range from spear-toting guards, to ramparts and fiery chasms (the latter of which is cleared by carefully timed jumps onto and off a constantly swinging rope).

Most of the game's screens also feature projectiles - in the form of fireballs and arrows - that must be avoided. These can appear from both the left and right-hand side of the screen and can be moving at one of two different heights and speeds. Some of the trickier screens contain more than one of these projectiles and contact with either a projectile or guard will result in Quasi falling from the castle wall, resulting in the loss of a player life.

To complicate matters further, each screen must be completed within a strict time limit. This takes the form of an enemy guard climbing the castle walls; if the guard reaches the top of the wall, he will walk towards Quasi to burn the Hunchback with his torch. If Quasi rings the bell before the guard has scaled the wall, a bonus score is rewarded. If five screens are completed without a life being lost, a 'Super Bonus' is awarded.

A meter at the bottom left corner of the screen - displaying a cutaway of castle ramparts - shows Quasi's progress towards the tower and his beloved Esmeralda. Upon reaching Esmeralda, players must complete a bonus screen - involving using moving ropes to collect bells from a series of platforms - to complete the rescue.

Once completed, the game starts over with a much higher level of difficulty and tighter time limits."

1753;hustle;hustle;"Hustle (c) 1977 Gremlin.
";"HUSTLE is a 1- or 2-player video game which challenges players' reaction time as they attempt to build up a high score. The object of the game is to maneuver a moving arrow into targets which appear randomly on the screen. Each arrow is accompanied by a tail, which can be used to block the opponent from scoring targets.

TARGETS : The targets appear randomly on the playfield. The position of a target, the value of a target, the time a target stays on the screen, and the time before a target appears are all unpredictable : There are never more than two targets on the screen at any time.

To add to the unpredictability, some targets appear with a value of ???. These are mystery targets, and can have a value from -900 points to +900 points. Players go after the mystery targets at their own risk since the only way to determine whether or not a mystery target is positive or negative is to hit the target. Whenever a target is scored, the game pauses while the appropriate player's score is tallied. Two distinctive sounds accompany the scoring, depending on whether the target score is positive or negative. All non-mystery targets (which are all positive), and all mystery targets (which have positive values) are scored with an attention-getting warble sound. All mystery targets which prove to be negative are scored with a distinctive penalty sound.

CRASHES : A crash (accompanied by a loud boom sound) occurs whenever a player hits anything other than a target. The three obstacles a player might hit are one of the screen boundaries, the other player's tail, or his own tail. Whenever a crash occurs, the opponent scores 400 points PLUS all target values on the screen. If any mystery targets are on the screen during a crash, their values are revealed, and they are awarded to the opponent. All mystery targets whose values are revealed as the result of a crash are scored positive for the opponent.

GAME SPEED : The game begins with the players moving at a moderate pace. Every time a target is scored, the pace picks up slightly. After ten targets have been scored without a crash, the pace stays at a maximum rate. Whenever a crash occurs, the pace reverts to its initial moderate value, and increases with each score, as before.

TAIL LENGTH : Whenever a crash occurs, both players' tails grow longer. The game plays quite differently as it progresses. At the beginning of a game, both players have short tails and are highly maneuverable. At this stage the game is a ""foot race"" to score the targets. As players crash and tails get longer, a blocking strategy is added to the race for the targets. This constantly changing nature of the game is designed to provide long-lasting appeal, and insure a long earning history.

SINGLE PLAYER : HUSTLE has been designed to be just as exciting for one player as it is for two. A single player plays against himself, and not against the computer.

The single player game is initiated by simply pressing the ONE PLAYER START button instead of the TWO PLAYER START button after inserting a coin. The controls for one player are located on the right side of the control panel. The game plays the same as for two players, with these exceptions :
1. There is a single arrow and tail, instead of two.
2. Crashes are scored as PENALTY points, with the same score as in the two player game. That is, a crash scores 400 plus all on-screen targets into the PENALTY score.
3. At the end of the game, the PENALTY points are subtracted from the player's score.

The object of the single player game is to rack up as many points as possible. The game action is the same as the two player game, with the lengthening tail and the accelerating pace."

Tap GO and player will accelerate, shoot or lift. Push UP and player will jump or shoot. The game offers seven different Olympic-based events, and players must achieve qualification in each event in order to progress to the next. Game is over if you fail to qualify in an event.

The seven events are : 

1) Swimming-100M Freestyle : Use GO and UP buttons to regulate the speed and breath of swimmer. Tap GO button(s) to accelerate swimmer. Press UP button to allow swimmer to breath when 'breath' display appears on the screen. Swimmer will submerge if UP button is pressed any other time. Equal the computer's time for 3000 point bonus. 

2) Skeet Shooting : Push either GO button to shoot. Shooting direction, left or right, coincide with GO button. Shoot clay within the red window to score.

A maze/top-down shooter game.

Set in the ancient medieval Japan, where a poor farming village is planning an insurrection to overthrow their feudal overlord. However, the only participants in the revolt are the player's character, Gonbe, and the optional second-player character, Tago, and the player battles against an army of ninjas, armed samurai a ghosts, and foot soldiers. The game has a great and colorful levels design, inspired in customs and myths Japanese of that time.

The character's movement is controlled with an 8-way joystick, and pressing the single button allows the player to attack by throwing a sickle. The direction in which the sickle is thrown cannot be determined by the player, and the weapon will automatically head towards the closest enemy. This forces an emphasis on avoiding attacks rather than attacking aggressively. The right side of the screen displays the player's points, along with a map of the level. The location of koban coins is displayed on this map, but players must circumvent walls and other barriers to go to those locations. The level is completed when the player picks up all 8 gold koban coins which are spread throughout the map, or if they capture the daikan (Japanese feudal lord) that can randomly appear during the level. 
The player loses a life when they come in contact with any of the enemy characters or projectiles. 

A bonus stage exist and some extras actions gameplay like grab a key to save a prisoner and especial items to increase speed of the character."

";"The goal is for the greedy protagonist to collect all the gold bars while jumping over or defeating various enemies and obstacles in each maze-like level. Some of these enemies are: Giant Baba (a Japanese wrestler), a moonwalking Michael Jackson, Madonna, Japanese comedian Tamori, Carl Lewis, moving statues (activated when passed by). Obstacles include: Gates, fire hydrants, safes (making it difficult to gain access to the gold), a rolling barrel, conveyor belts, and a swimming pool with platforms ranging in size and strength. When you collect all the gold in a given level, you must cash it into a building (labeled ""out"" when the level begins and ""in"" once you retrieve all the gold) to beat the level. The player can only hold ten bars of gold at once. In later levels there are more than 10 bars of gold, so the player must make multiple deposits.

Tamori, Michael Jackson, Carl Lewis, and Madonna can all be killed with one punch. Punching Giant Baba stuns him, more are required to actually kill him. The closer the player is to Giant Baba the faster he can be killed. Madonna has a range attack where she begins to jump and then launches a kiss at you. Carl Lewis jumps, so he can be walked under but he is more difficult to punch. When an enemy is killed it later respawns. The barrels cannot be killed. If the player is caught by Tamori (the guy with the sunglasses), the player's clothes will change into a white diaper while the captor changes into a leather S&M bikini and lashes his whip on the crying protagonist's back."

1826;irobot;irobot;"I, Robot (c) 1983 Atari.
";"I, Robot is a 3-D shoot-em-up in which the player controls the ""Unhappy Interface Robot #1984""; a servant robot who has become self-aware and decided to rebel against the all-controlling Big Brother and his ever-watchful 'Evil Eyes'.

The game is set over a series of platform-based stages constructed from solid coloured blocks and to complete a stage, players must ""eliminate the red zones"". This is achieved by moving the robot over all of a stage's red surfaces, changing their colour to blue. The colour scheme - including target colour - changes every 26 levels, however. So while the target colour is red for the first 26 screens, it becomes yellow from Level 27, blue from Level 53 and magenta from Level 79.

In order to reach all of the platforms and surfaces, the Interface robot will need to jump. This must be carefully timed, however, as jumping is not allowed under Big Brother's strict regime and his Evil eye - sitting atop a pyramid at the back of the playfield - will open at regular intervals to watch over the interface robot. Should the eye be fully open - indicated by it turning red - when the robot is mid-jump, he will be spotted and destroyed, costing the player a life.

Once all of the coloured squares on a stage have been eliminated, the enemy's shield is destroyed and the Interface Robot will need to be guided to a final, previously inaccessible coloured square at the back of the playfield. The Evil Eye is then zapped and destroyed.

Some levels feature different background elements that affect gameplay, such as walls that must be shot and destroyed to reach coloured tiles, or indestructible moving columns that intermittently block access to coloured tiles, making timing difficult. There are also enemies to be shot or avoided, including birds, bombs and flying sharks.

Once the eye has been beaten, Interface Robot automatically jumps to the top of the pyramid and launches itself into space. A short inter-level ""Space Wave"" to the next stage follows. These stages feature polygonal objects hurling through space that must be either avoided or destroyed.

Every third level contains a red pyramid that must entered once all coloured squares are eliminated. Once inside, the Robot has one chance to collect as many bonus jewels as possible before destroying the Evil Eye. If the Robot is destroyed while inside the pyramid, he is immediately thrust back into space. The player must then battle through three more levels and destroy a further three Evil Eyes before getting another chance to collect any high scoring pyramid jewels.

After every fourth level, the Space Wave stage features a battle with Big Brother himself, shown as a huge, disembodied polygonal head. Big Brother constantly spits cone-shaped projectiles from his mouth and every single one of these must be shot or they will collide with and kill the player.

The head can be forced to rotate by repeatedly shooting the side of its face. If the head isn't facing the robot, danger is minimized since he won't fire his cone-shaped projectiles when facing away. Players must simply survive this encounter for about 20 seconds, after which Big Brother flies away and the next level begins.

I, Robot features 126 stages, with 26 unique level designs. After level 26, the designs repeat at a higher difficulty level and with an altered colour palette. The on-screen level counter is only two digits, so levels 100–126 are displayed as 0–26 respectively. On passing level 126, the player gets thrown back to a random earlier level.

Once the game is underway, pressing the one-player Start button will incrementally zooms the game's camera closer in to the action, while the two-player Start button pulls it further back, offering new viewing angles of the playfield. Closer camera angles result in higher score multipliers, due to the increased difficulty of visibility. In later levels, enemies known as ""Viewer Killers"" directly attack the player rather than the robot, forcing players to either switch camera angles, or move the robot to scroll the camera away from the Viewer Killers

'I, Robot' was - in both technical and design terms - ahead of its time and the game featured many new and ground-breaking innovations that the games industry would later adopt. The most striking and obvious of these was the game's graphics. While 'I, Robot' wasn't the world's first three-dimensional game, it was the first to feature solid, filled-polygon graphics, as opposed to the wire-frame graphics adopted by earlier titles. The concept of players being able to switch viewpoints also appeared here first.

The final innovation was 'Doodle City'. Instead of playing the game, players could instead choose to use the game's colourful three-dimensional objects to draw pictures on the monitor screen. Doodle City lasts for three minutes per credit, although players can switch back to playing 'I, Robot' at any time. When switching back to the game, the number of lives the player has is dictated by how much time was spent on Doodle City, with one life taken away for every minute in the ""Ungame"" mode."

The ultimate aim of the game is to reach and destroy the Death Star and escape alive. Success is achieved by surviving an 'attack wave', which consists of four different scenes. Play switches between Endor and space-based scenes, with each one putting the player in control of a different vehicle from the movie. 

The scenes are based on three distinct locations taken from the original movie. They are: The forest moon of Endor, Attack on the Death Star, and Space battle. 

* SCENE 1: Speeder Bike chase on Endor as Princess Leia. The goal is to reach the Ewok village alive. 

* SCENE 2: Scout Walker chase on Endor as Chewbacca. The goal is to reach the shield generator. 

* SCENE 3: Millennium Falcon attack on Death Star as Lando. The goal is to reach and destroy the Death Star power reactor. 

* SCENE 4: Millennium Falcon escape from exploding Death Star. The goal is to escape the exploding Death Star. 

* SPLIT SCENE: Play switches between scenes 2 and 3. 

The scenes loop for as long as the player has lives remaining; although to increase variety, the order in which they appear is randomised as play progresses. Each successive wave increases in difficulty."

";"The Play mode begins when either the 1-PLAYER or the 2-PLAYER START button is pressed. The Play mode ends when all of your performers have been eliminated. When this happens, GAME OVER is written across the center of the monitor screen.

ON THE SCREEN : The game is made up of groups of 5 sequences for each rack. When play begins, all the performers run onto the screen and jump aboard their transport ship, the Scarab. The Scarab then lifts off and heads for a point in space that is at the center of a grouping of five planets. (The song that is played in the background during this scene is 'Lights'.) Each group member's instrument is on a different planet.

At the beginning of each sequence, when a 2-PLAYER game has been selected, the game tells which player is up.

Also indicated in each sequence of each rack is the number of players (1 or 2), a running total of the player score(s), and the highest game score to date.

PLAY BEGINS : From this point, the player has approximately 10 seconds to decide which planet he wants to take the Scarab to (which performer’s instrument he wants to retrieve). The Scarab is guided to the planet of your choice by using the control stick to direct its movement.

OBSTACLES : On each planet there are various obstacles that must be overcome in order for that particular performer to retrieve his instrument and make his way back to the Scarab.

1st PLANET - Microphone : Steve Perry must pass between the turnstiles without touching them, get his microphone, and shoot his way back to the Scarab. The background song for this scene is 'Don't Stop Believing'.

2nd PLANET - Bass : Here, Ross Valory must leap onto the elevating pedestals, timing his assent to grab his bass as it passes by him at the top of the screen, and shoot his way back to the Scarab. The song played in the background here is 'Keep On Running'.

3rd PLANET - Keyboard : Here, Jonathan Cain must leap the moving conveyor belt ridges without being touched to reach his keyboard and then must shoot his way back to the Scarab. The background song here is 'Stone in Love'.

4th PLANET - Guitar : With his jet pack, Neal Schon must traverse the dangerous passages in this cavern to finally retrieve his guitar and then fight his way back to the Scarab. 'Chain Reaction' plays in the background here.

5th PLANET - Drums : Steve Smith must jump from drum-head to drum-head, landing on all of them at least once in order to reach his drums. He then must shoot his way back to the Scarab. 'Wheel in the Sky' is the background song here.

ALL INSTRUMENTS RETRIEVED : All the performers now move to a stage and give a performance of 'Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)', their latest hit blockbuster at the time of this game's release. They will play as long as Herbie, the bouncer (controlled by the player), can keep the excited fans from overrunning the stage. When this happens, play starts all over again in the next rack which will be more difficult to complete. The performers all have to retrieve their instruments again.

SEQUENCES : Play ends in any particular sequence when one of 3 things happens.
a. The performer has a mishap and, except for Steve Perry, falls to the bottom of the screen. (A sample of 'Who's Crying Now' will play in the background.)
b. The performer retrieves his instrument and shoots his way back to the Scarab.
c. The excited fans storm the stage (play advances to the next rack of 5 sequences).

PERFORMERS : When on each of the 5 planets, the performer's movements are controlled by the control stick on the games control panel. They can basically move in any direction.

MISHAP : Play will begin again (if you have reserve performers left) in space, all performers are in the Scarab, and the player has approximately 10 seconds to pick the next planet he wants to try.
NOTE : You cannot pick a planet where the performer has already retrieved his instrument. These planets are indicated to the player by a wavey white ring around them.
If there are no more reserve performers left, GAME OVER is written across the screen.

SCARAB VEHICLE : The Scarab can move in any direction on the screen. Its movements are controlled by the control stick on the games control panel.

FIRE CONTROL BUTTONS : These control the rate of fire of your performer in; either left, right, up, or down directions (certain performers can only fire in certain directions). There are 2-fire control buttons on the Upright models to allow both left and right handed persons to play the game easily.

CONTROL STICK : By using the control stick you can position the Scarab/performer/bouncer at any location you desire on the screen.

BONUS PERFORMERS : These can be awarded to the player as he reaches or passes certain preselected point values. This feature is adjustable by the game's owner/operator.

GAME ENDS : When your last performer is eliminated. GAME OVER is written across the monitor screen."
1860;joust;joust;"Joust (c) 1982 Williams.
";"Joust is a platform-based action combat game for one or two-players (with the two-player game offering either team-up OR head-to-head combat; the first time arcade gamers were given this choice) in which each player controls a knight riding on the back of a flying ostrich. 

The object of the game is to progress through platform-based levels by defeating groups of buzzard-riding enemy knights. This is achieved by 'jousting'; both enemy and player knights carry a lance and must fly around the level (actioned by repeatedly hitting the 'Flap' button) trying to oust rival knights from their steeds by ramming them with the lance. This can only be achieved if the attacking rider is above the enemy knight when the lance connects. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other, but if a player is lower than their enemy at the instant of contact, they themselves will be knocked from their steed and lose a life. 

A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls to the bottom of the screen. This must be quickly collected by players as if the egg lands on a platform and isn't retrieved in time, it will eventually hatch into another enemy knight that must be defeated again. 

Joust features three different types of enemy knights - Bounder, Hunter, and Shadow Lord - with each earning players different points values when defeated. A pterodactyl will appear after a predetermined time to hunt the players. 

Accurately navigating the player Knights can be initially quite difficult as control is strongly affected by both gravity and inertia. Players can lose a life by either being knocked from their steed by an enemy knight, or by falling into the lava pit at the bottom of each level."

";"On the planet of the floating cliffs, society calls upon its wing-mounted Gladiators to solve conflicts. You, the Gladiator, must enter the fray, participating in a challenge of honor, a Joust... where only the fittest survive! 

The legend of ""Joust"" continues in Joust 2. Players must solve the puzzle of what strategy will be most effective in dealing with the buzzards and other winged enemies on each of Joust 2's 35 different backgrounds. 

The object of Joust 2 is to defeat all winged enemies by colliding with them. To survive a collision (joust), the Gladiator's lance must be higher. 

Defeating a Buzzard Enemy in a Joust causes release of an Egg. Eggs may be caught in the air or collected on landing areas for bonus points. Be Careful! Eggs falling into the Lava form into aggressive mutants, while uncollected Eggs hatch into dangerous warriors. 

Danger lurks everywhere! Giant Statues come to life; Bats fall out of crystals embedded in the rocks; Lava Trolls and Water Monsters eat unsuspecting bird-mounts; Lightning fills the air; and Unbeatable? Pterodactyls patrol the skies. A gigantic Knight presides on several waves. You, the Gladiator, must destroy him! Hitting all four of his red pins explodes the Knight and all his servants. 

Gold Egg Feature : A Gold Egg may randomly appear on any wave. Collecting the Gold Egg before it hatches opens a window of awards in the background. To collect an award, step on the red button above the window before a timer expires. Both players reap the benefits of the posted award, which may include bonuses of 1,000 to 10,000 points, 'super zapping' all enemies on the screen, or even receiving an extra life. 

Prepare thyself for War! 

Buy-In : Joust 2 is designed for action entertainment for one or two simultaneous players. Players who have started the game may continue where they left off by using the buy-in feature. When a player has used all of his lives, he will hear : ""Wish to continue?"" A 10-second timer appears in the players score area to allow the game to continue by using a Credit, or inserting a coin, before the player presses the Start button.

1862;joustr;joustr;"Joust (c) 1982 Williams.
";"Joust is a platform-based action combat game for one or two-players (with the two-player game offering either team-up OR head-to-head combat; the first time arcade gamers were given this choice) in which each player controls a knight riding on the back of a flying ostrich. 

The object of the game is to progress through platform-based levels by defeating groups of buzzard-riding enemy knights. This is achieved by 'jousting'; both enemy and player knights carry a lance and must fly around the level (actioned by repeatedly hitting the 'Flap' button) trying to oust rival knights from their steeds by ramming them with the lance. This can only be achieved if the attacking rider is above the enemy knight when the lance connects. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other, but if a player is lower than their enemy at the instant of contact, they themselves will be knocked from their steed and lose a life. 

A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls to the bottom of the screen. This must be quickly collected by players as if the egg lands on a platform and isn't retrieved in time, it will eventually hatch into another enemy knight that must be defeated again. 

Joust features three different types of enemy knights - Bounder, Hunter, and Shadow Lord - with each earning players different points values when defeated. A pterodactyl will appear after a predetermined time to hunt the players. 

Accurately navigating the player Knights can be initially quite difficult as control is strongly affected by both gravity and inertia. Players can lose a life by either being knocked from their steed by an enemy knight, or by falling into the lava pit at the bottom of each level."

1864;joyfulr;joyfulr;"Joyful Road (c) 1983 SNK.
";"A weird driving game with a car that has long arms that reach out to grab a variety of edible items that appear along roadside.

The object is to drive safely down the road. Pick up enough fuel to stay alive while avoiding other vehicles that go by, grab as many bonus objects as possible including apples, cherries, bananas, acorns, live fish and money, and park your car in the garage. Driving while trying to pick up the goodies is difficult and you can crash very easily on the narrow roads. The pace of the game is frustrating because the hands move slowly while the car itself moves really fast, especially in the later rounds. If one of your hands hits a tree or any other foreign object in its quest for food, the car winces in pain for a few moments until it can use its hands again.

You can get a bonus for putting used-up food into garbage cans. Grabbing fish which leap out of surrounding rivers is a safe bet, but most other bonuses are placed, so you can crash if you try to grab them. The best strategy is only to go for the fuel, since the car is a big gas guzzler and you can also get a bonus for leftover fuel at the end of the drive."

This hack of ""PuckMan"" drastically changes the artwork of both Pac-Man and the ghosts, to some more abstract yellow character, and various colored cyclopes respectively (the eyes have naturally been turned into one single eye).

Joyman also contains a very altered maze, changing the colors, and the arrangment of the allies. The allies are arranged more like columns than before.

There are dots that straddle several of the allies. While the dots are present, and as long as Joyman does not lose a life, Joyman can continue to pass through the gaps in allies. However, if Joyman loses a life, some of the gaps close upon his return in the next life.

The bonus prizes and the music have also changed.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Losing a life can cause the maze to change. There are places in the maze where the walls are broken and dots are placed. As long as you have not lost a life, you can go through the walls and eat the dots. However, once you do lose a life, the walls fill in the spaces where you've already eaten the dots, making the rack that much harder to fill."

Jurassic Park features Sega's often-used and highly effective sprite scaled graphics and is very similar in style to another Sega Lightgun shoot-em-up, 1991's ""Rail Chase"".

1868;jrpacman;jrpacman;"Jr. Pac-Man (c) 1983 Bally Midway.
";"One of many sequels to the legendary ""Pac-Man"", Jr. Pac-Man features the character of Pac-Man's son. For the first time in the series' history, side-scrolling mazes were introduced, with each maze being two screens wide. 

This time, the mazes have no exit tunnels through which players can make an escape. The bonus items that appear move around the maze and are now something of a mixed blessing, as not only will they destroy any Power Pills they come across, but they will also turn any normal dots they pass over into large dots that slow the player's movements considerably, but are worth more points than normal dots if eaten by the player. Any mutated dots in the maze will disappear if the player loses a life. 

The Pac character is once again pursued by four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Tim) in his quest to eat all of the dots in each maze. And, as before, numerous Power Pills litter the mazes that, when eaten, allow Jr. to eat the pursuing ghosts. 

As with previous ""Pac-Man"" games, intermissions are featured between certain levels. Jr. Pac-Man's intermissions are episodic in nature, like those found in ""Ms. Pac-Man"". Jr. Pac-Man's story tells of the blossoming love between Jr. Pac-Man and a small ghost named Yum-Yum. 

Act I - Jr. Meets Yum-Yum : Jr. Pac-Man steps outside his home to play. He spots Yum-Yum beyond the fence in his yard and goes outside to meet her. Blinky, hiding in the shadows, comes out from hiding to catch Jr. However Ms. Pac-Man, keeping a watchful eye over her child, sees the commotion from her window and runs out to the yard to eat a Power Pill and chase both ghosts away while Jr. returns to the safety of home. This intermission is played after Round 1. 

Act II - The Gift : It seems that Jr. can't get the enchanting young ghost out of his mind, so he proceeds to bring a balloon to her as a gift the next day. Excited to see her, he meets her on a bridge and hands her the balloon, when we catch a glimpse of Blinky lurking behind a bush. This intermission is played after Round 3. 

Act III - They Escape : Blinky moves from one bush to the another, startling Yum-Yum into releasing the balloon. Blinky attempts to capture Jr. once and for all, but once again, Ms. Pac-Man comes to the rescue. Blinky chases her off to the left, while Jr. Pac-Man and Yum-Yum escape to the right. Once alone, they gaze in to each other's eyes and fall in love, with hearts appearing all around them. This intermission is played after Rounds 5, 7, and 9."

- TRIVIA -

Released in October 1982, this reworked version of ""Jungle King"" was the end result of a copyright infringement lawsuit filed against Taito by the estate of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of Tarzan.

Here's what makes Jungle Hunt different from Jungle King: 
* Music is played at the places where the Tarzan yell was originally heard - at the beginning of the game and at the end of the avalanche stage - the same music that plays upon completion of the river stage. 
* The player character is a safari-suited jungle explorer clad in a pith helmet, jacket, and shorts, instead of the Tarzan look-alike. 
* The life-lines that the player character swings on between the trees in the first stage are ropes instead of vines.

The original version of the game, known as Jungle King, featured a character who looked like the well known (and very much copyrighted) Tarzan. The character even sounded like Tarzan when he bellowed out the famous scream after finishing the boulder stage (and at the beginning of the game). So, for legal reasons, the name was changed to 'Jungle Hunt' and the player character was changed to resemble a classic safari-suited jungle explorer complete with the standard issue pith helmet, jacket, and shorts. The bellowed scream at the end of the boulder stage was also entirely removed, replaced by the music from the end of the river stage.

A Jungle Hunt unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames'. 

Michael Torcello holds the official record for this game with 1,510,220 points.

";"Jungle King is a jungle adventure game where players take on the role of Jungle King, a Tarzan-like jungle man, who is going in search of his Jungle Princess, who has been kidnapped by a pair of barbaric cannibals. 

Jungle King has four stages, each with its own unique scenarios, so each stage could be considered a separate game in its own right. 

It is noticable that this game scrolls from right to left, while the vast majority of scrollers go from left to right, although most people probably wouldn't even notice that. 

Jungle King's gameplay is very similar to that of Activision's ""Pitfall"", a classic arcade game released on many home computer and console formats of the time. 

The game's stages are as follows : 
* The first stage, which may have been the best stage in the game, is set in a forest with a series of swinging vines. Players must use the JUMP button to move from right to left across the vines, while avoiding the monkeys that can send Jungle King falling to the ground. This level is easy to master, but players must time their jumps carefully to make it to the next vine. 
* The second stage is set under a jungle river. Players must guide Jungle King through a river infestest with alligators and crocodiles. This stage features a 'breath meter' that must be carefully watched to avoid drowning (players simply swim up to the surface to get more air). Jungle King is armed with a knife with which he can stab the crocs and gators, but this can only be done when their mouths are not fully open. 
* The third stage is an avalanche with boulders rolling down a hill. The player simply uses the joystick to control Jungle King's climbing speed up the hill, and the JUMP button to leap over rolling boulders until they reach the end of the stage. 
* The fourth and final stage has the player guiding Jungle King through a cannibal village. Jungle King must jump over the cannibals while their spears are down, and eventually make his way towards his Jungle Princess, who is being lowered into a pot to be boiled for supper. 

On completion of the game, players are rewarded with a short 'I Love You' ending, and then the game begins again with increased difficulty."

Zeus raised the warrior from the grave and granted him the power to morph into a powerful, holy beast in order to do battle against the unspeakable horrors of the Underworld.

Juuouki is a 1-player sideways scrolling beat-em-up. The game begins with the player controlling the human form of the resurrected warrior. During the levels the warrior will be attacked by a number of flashing animals. Destroying these creatures will result in an orb being dropped. If the player picks up an orb, he will begin his transformation from human into 'Beast'. Once 3 orbs have been collected, the transformation is complete. In beast form the player's character is much faster and stronger than in the human form, and also has the ability to throw fireballs at the enemy. At the end of each stage, after the boss fight, the player's special powers are taken from him and he once again reverts to human form.

Another unique feature are power zones, these are activated when landing a special move when a character's Power (Crush in the Japanese version) meter is full. Power zones contain electricity or fire that can help improve a character's special move. Stage backgrounds can also be destroyed by the combat, getting hit fills the Power meter and when a special move connects when it is full, it greatly damages the background walls and can unlock the fire or electric zones found in levels."

Players enter a karate tournament - having first selected their preferred skill level, from either White, Brown or Black belt - and fight against a number of progressively tougher opponents. Each victory awards the player with a higher belt grade within their current belt colour - white grade six to white grade five, for example - and if the player wins the tournament, he or she is awarded a higher belt colour and the game ends. If players chooses to play the game on the 'Black Belt' skill level, defeating opponents is awarded with a higher grade, or 'dan' of Black Belt.

Karate Tournament uses a distinctive graphical technique in that it 'morphs' some of the combatants' movement graphics to simulate speed and motion blur.

";"The quest to defeat the mysterious Baron of Battlers, the mysterious ""K"", is on. In order to get to this grotesque gladiator, you need to fight your way through 13 with the most skilled, most deadly of all combatants in the world of physical contact. Use your powers of pulverization, psychic energy blasts, and ridiculous strength to become the explosive fighting god in FIGHTER'S HISTORY DYNAMITE!!!

Don't just participate in history, MAKE IT! The sequel of the first ""Fighter's History"", this time ported in the Neo Geo MVS Hardware. In this new version of the original game several changes and improvements were made to enhance the gameplay: now the battles are faster and more technical, with the usual friendly combo system that makes the fight so spectacular. There are also some powerful hidden moves added for most of the characters. Even the graphic was slightly enhanced, with a nice color palette and some wonderful backgrounds (especially Zazie's).

The game actually suffered from the reputation to be a 'SFII clone' given by the general opinion from the first episode. Thanks to this new chapter of the saga, which was particularly appreciated by the Neo Geo fans because it is one of the rare 'SFII style' beat'em ups on the Neo Geo this changed.

A really nice and classical beat'em up, still worthy to be played, especially for the real fans of the 2-D beat'em up."

";"10 genetically engineered fighters engage in 1-on-1 combat in a tournament arranged by the sinister 'Ultratech', the organization behind the genetic creation of the fighters. The tournament soon turns into a battle for survival.

Each player starts the game with 2 energy bars, which represent the amount of health each player has for the entire game. Once the first bar is depleted, the player falls, gets up and starts to use the second energy bar. A voice will subsequently announce either 'Round Two' or 'Killer Instinct!'. The player who wins the first round gets to keep their remaining energy, and still has the second bar to use in future fights. This gives an advantage to the player who wins the first round.

Killer Instinct introduced incredibly complex combos to the fighting genre, as well as including the Fatalities and Humiliations made famous by Midway's ""Mortal Kombat"" Series."

The plot follows on where the first installment left off. Eyedol's death at the hands of Orchid accidentally sets off a time warp, transporting some of the combatants back in time and allowing the Demon Lord Gargos to escape from Limbo.

Now, trapped 2000 years in the past, the warriors that survived Killer Instinct, along with several new faces, fight for the right to face Gargos in combat. Each character that survived the journey from the first game has a corresponding background story, while new characters on this installment are native inhabitants of this past time period. Some fighters, like T.J. Combo who survives from the original, just want to get home. Others, like new character Tusk, want to bring an end to Gargos and his reign of evil. This time there is no tournament or prize money, just a fight to the finish with the fate of the future hanging in the balance."
1939;kirameki;kirameki;"Kirameki Star Road - Intro Club (c) 1997 Taito.
";"Kirameki Star Road is a music trivia game for one or two players where the player assumes the role of a music talent scout. At the start of the game the player chooses one of three girls to promote as a new music idol.  The object of the game is to listen to a piece of popular music and select the correct musician or title for the song before the timer runs out. After getting a set number of questions right, the player will be rated on their performance and will be shown how the girls popularity is advancing within certain demographics.

At each new stage the player gets to pick the genre from which the music selections will be pooled from and also gets to see the selected girl in a new costume. In the first stage the girl is scouted in her school uniform, the second stage involves a swimsuit audition, and later stage costumes are decided by the genre of music selected for that stage.

At certain stages in the game, the player is treated to a mini-game instead of the usual trivia.  Stage three is a dance stage, where the player is shown a combination of joystick and button moves and must then repeat them from memory.  Stage six is a photo shoot stage, where the player must attempt to frame the girl in a series of photos as the camera quickly shifts around. And Stage eight requires the player to shake off nosy tabloid paparazzi.

Each mistake in the trivia or mini games leads to a lost life.  The game is over once a player looses all their lives."

As a unique feature, not every winning hand played by the player will lead to a strip sequence. Lesser winning hands will instead add time to a quiz game that can be played between hands. The game will display how many seconds of playtime the player has earned for the quiz game and the player can select whether to attempt the quiz sequence, or skip ahead to the next hand and earn a longer time limit.

Correct answers given during the quiz game will remove panels placed over the girls image. If the player removes all of the panels before the timer runs out then the next strip sequence will be revealed. Failing this, if the player correctly answered any questions during the quiz sequence they will be awarded a cheat item for use in the next hand.

The game is over when a player runs out of betting funds."

When you complete a wave, the crowd cheers. Let a tile fall in the pit, and you hear a scream as it falls in. If you fail to complete a wave, the crowd is disappointed. Stay alive, complete the waves and don't drop any tiles!

Catch the tiles as they come to the end of the ramp on the paddle. Flip a tile into a bin by pressing the start/flip button. Pull the joystick forward to increase the speed of the closest tile as it klanks down the ramp. Push the joystick back and toss the top tile on the paddle back on the ramp and gain a little time.

The paddle can hold up to five tiles. As long as the green light is on below the paddle, you can pile more tiles on the paddle. When the red light appears, you must flip at least one tile in a bin or toss it back on the ramp before you can collect any more tiles. You can flip tiles into a bin as long as the green light is on below the bin.

To succeed in Klax, make points and also complete each wave. Create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of at least three tiles (just like in tic-tac-toe) in the bins to make a Klax and make points. You receive the most points for diagonals, less for horizontals and the least for verticals. When you create a Klax, the tiles in the Klax disappear to make room for more tiles in the bins.

Each wave has a different task to be completed, which is shown on the To Go Meter. This task could be making a certain number of Klaxes or points or surviving a certain number of tiles. Complete the task before too many tiles drop in the pit and you complete the wave. When you complete a wave, you receive bonus points for the tiles remaining on the ramp, on the paddle, and any empty spaces in the bins. If you fail, you can start again at the same wave.

Klax does not have a clock for you to race against, but as your playing time increases, the tiles klank down the ramp faster and faster.

Waves : When you first enter the game, you can start at wave 1, 6, or 11. Wave 1 teaches you how to play the game and use the controls. At every fifth wave you can choose to play the next wave, the fifth wave beyond, or the tenth wave beyond.

Klax has five different types of waves and more than five different backgrounds. There are five waves per level, and one hundred waves to complete.

Each time you begin a wave, the To Go meter shows what kind of Klaxes or how many points you need to accumulate to complete the wave. The different types of waves are :
* Klaxes To Go, which are the easiest. Just create Klaxes horizontally, vertically or horizontally. Create enough Klaxes to complete the wave before you drop too many tiles in the pit.
* Tiles To Go requires you to survive a certain number of tiles. Create Klaxes in any of the three ways to collect points and to clear the bins to hold more tiles.
* Points To Go requires you to make a certain number of points. Create Klaxes to collect points but make diagonals, four- or five-of-a-kind Klaxes, and simultaneous Klaxes for higher points.
* Diagonals To Go requires you to create diagonals. Create Klaxes in any way to collect points; but only the correct number of diagonals will complete the wave.
* Horizontals To Go requires you to create horizontals. Only horizontal Klaxes will complete the wave; but you can create Klaxes vertically and diagonally to collect points.

You see several kinds of information on the screen. These are the :
* To Go Meter which continuously calculates the number of Klaxes, tiles, points, diagonals or horizontals still required to complete the wave. The number depends on the type of wave you are playing.
* Drop Count, which shows the number of dropped tiles. The drop count is continuously calculated. When the number of tiles dropped is reached, the wave is over.

Each wave has a different task to be completed, which is shown on the To Go Meter. This task could be making a certain number of Klaxes or points or surviving a certain number of tiles. Complete the task before too many tiles drop in the pit and you complete the wave. When you complete a wave, you receive bonus points for the tiles remaining on the ramp, on the paddle, and any empty spaces in the bins. If you fail, you can start again at the same wave.

Klax does not have a clock for you to race against, but as your playing time increases, the tiles klank down the ramp faster and faster.

Waves : When you first enter the game, you can start at wave 1, 6, or 11. Wave 1 teaches you how to play the game and use the controls. At every fifth wave you can choose to play the next wave, the fifth wave beyond, or the tenth wave beyond.

Klax has five different types of waves and more than five different backgrounds. There are five waves per level, and one hundred waves to complete.

Each time you begin a wave, the To Go meter shows what kind of Klaxes or how many points you need to accumulate to complete the wave. The different types of waves are :
* Klaxes To Go, which are the easiest. Just create Klaxes horizontally, vertically or horizontally. Create enough Klaxes to complete the wave before you drop too many tiles in the pit.
* Tiles To Go requires you to survive a certain number of tiles. Create Klaxes in any of the three ways to collect points and to clear the bins to hold more tiles.
* Points To Go requires you to make a certain number of points. Create Klaxes to collect points but make diagonals, four- or five-of-a-kind Klaxes, and simultaneous Klaxes for higher points.
* Diagonals To Go requires you to create diagonals. Create Klaxes in any way to collect points; but only the correct number of diagonals will complete the wave.
* Horizontals To Go requires you to create horizontals. Only horizontal Klaxes will complete the wave; but you can create Klaxes vertically and diagonally to collect points.

You see several kinds of information on the screen. These are the :
* To Go Meter which continuously calculates the number of Klaxes, tiles, points, diagonals or horizontals still required to complete the wave. The number depends on the type of wave you are playing.
* Drop Count, which shows the number of dropped tiles. The drop count is continuously calculated. When the number of tiles dropped is reached, the wave is over.
* High Score, which shows the highest score to date, regardless of the number of continues that player had.
* Wave Indicator, which shows what wave you are playing."

";"The left joystick controls the movement of the player character, Colwyn. He can be moved in any one of eight directions. The right joystick controls the movement of the player's weapon, the glaive. It can be thrown in any one of eight directions. Four glaives can be in flight at one time and will return to Colwyn with a boomerang-type action. The one and two player select buttons are also located on the panel.

Krull consists of five subgames :
1. The Mountain Game.
2. The Swamp Game.
3. The Fortress Game.
4. The Hexagon Game.
5. The Beast Game.

The player must accomplish a task in each of the five games with eight levels of difficulty in each. All eight levels can be reached in one task based on the time spent performing that task (amount of time spent on that subgame). The total number of lethal characters on the screen at one time increases as the levels increase.

FROM THE SKY WILL COME THE BLACK FORTRESS. FROM THE FORTRESS WILL COME THE SLAYERS, TO DEVOUR THE PLANET OF KRULL. THEN SHALL A GIRL OF ANCIENT NAME BECOME QUEEN, AND THE KING SHE CHOOSES SHALL RULE THE PLANET.

The planet Krull is threatened by the Beast. His army of Slayers has brought terror to the land. Colwyn must stop this terror and save the land and its people. On the day Colwyn is to wed the Princess Lyssa, the Slayers, army of the Beast, kidnap her to become the Beast's bride. Colwyn must reach the Black Fortress and reclaim his Princess. He who marries the Princess shall be king. The Beast must not be allowed to rule the planet.

A prophet acquaints Colwyn with the magical properties of the glaive, a five-bladed sword, which Colwyn must acquire. To accomplish this task, he must climb the mountain and collect the five individual blades of the glaive in order to assemble the weapon. The blade is picked up by touching Colwyn to the blade. Boulders are fatal and must be avoided. The weapon joystick is not utilized in this subgame. The player is awarded 1,000 points for each blade picked up. Points are also awarded for placing Colwyn in a dangerous position in front of one or more boulders.

During his travels to discover the Black Fortress, Colwyn comes upon an army of eight men that he befriends and recruits to help him in his quest to destroy the Beast so that Krull can be safe from his evil.

With no intentions of losing his newly acquired bride without bloodshed, the Beast orders an army of Slayers to stop Colwyn and his friends. Forging through the quicksand-riddled swamps, Slayers materialize from the soil and Colwyn prepares for battle. In the second subgame, Colwyn must save as many friends as possible while killing all of the Slayers. The friends are saved by touching them and the Slayers are destroyed by the glaive. The Slayers themselves and their spears must be avoided. The game begins with eight friends. The number of friends saved is the number of friends carried over into future subgames. The friends can eliminate the Slayers with hand-to-hand combat but can also be destroyed themselves. Receiving three blows either by hand-to-hand or by the Slayers spear is fatal to the friends. The subgame ends when there are no longer any friends to save and all of the Slayers have been eliminated. Avoid quicksand, as it slows Colwyn's attack. Each friend saved awards 1,000 points (maximum 8,000 points) and 100 points for each Slayer the player eliminates.

After days of travel, Colwyn and his men have found the Black Fortress in the Iron Desert where many dangers await them. While attempting to lead his men through the dangerous narrow passageways that lead to the Fortress, Slayers materialize once again in a second attempt to stop Colwyn's struggle. In this third subgame, Colwyn must pick up all of his friends and deposit them safely into the hexagon while again combating the Slayers. The total number of friends in this subgame is equal to the total number of friends saved in Subgame 2. This subgame concludes when all of the friends have been delivered to the hexagon. The player is awarded 1,000 points for each friend delivered to the hexagon, 100 points for each Slayer he destroys and 100 points for each Slayer remaining when the last friend is delivered to the hexagon.

Victorious in battle, Colwyn must now attempt to release his friends from the hexagon. Unlike entry, exiting the hexagon is a struggle deservant of its own merit. Once again Colwyn must call upon the power of the glaive. Release of his friends is accomplished by throwing the glaive at the front wall while it is black only. Any glaive striking the wall while it is not black will stick in the wall until the wall becomes black. The Slayers, of course, attempt to stop Colwyn's efforts. In his own attempt for survival, Colwyn must fight them off and avoid their spears. The subgame ends when the last black wall is broken through and the friends have escaped. The player is awarded 100 points for each Slayer he puts an end to, 100 points for each Slayer remaining when the friends are set free and 1,000 points for the first black wall destroyed, 2,000 points for the second, 3,000 points for the third and 4,000 points for the fourth.

Now inside the Black Fortress, Colwyn secedes from his friends in order to rescue the Princess Lyssa. He finds her in a large cave carefully guarded by the Beast. He knows that the only way to reclaim his bride and conserve the planet is to forge into battle with the Beast. In the fifth subgame, the player moves Colwyn towards the Princess in order to reach her. As he progresses, the Beast attempts to stop him by throwing fireballs at him. The fireballs must be avoided or destroyed by the glaive. If not destroyed, the fireballs will ricochet off of the walls. Destroying a fireball awards the player 100 points multiplied by the number of fireballs in flight. The Beast is momentarily stunned when hit with a glaive and awards the player 100 points. The Beast cannot be destroyed and the player must avoid touching him. When Colwyn reaches the Princess, his friends, following the pandemonium of the battle, appear and chase the Beast off, awarding 1000 points per friend. The total number of friends in this subgame is equal to the total number of friends saved in Subgame 2."

";"Lady killer is an adult, puzzle game featuring eight sexy women.  The objective of the game is to dive and leap through the surface of the play area to reveal the image of the girl underneath.

At the start of each level the player gets to select which girl he wants to reveal.  Her image is then shown and is then covered by the game board.  Then the level begins. The player must move to avoid the enemies while attempting to flip the tiles on the board by diving and surfacing through them.  Flipped tiles often reveal power-ups to help the player. The player is killed any time he touches or is shot by an enemy, but the player can kill enemies by flipping a tile that the enemy is standing on. Enemies will re-spawn until the level is completed. The level is completed once all of the tiles have been removed.

Each girl features five states of undress and four stages. During gameplay, the girl's silhouette remains visible through the surface of the game play area and while her state of dress changes between stages, her pose and silhouette will remain the same. Each girl also has a special stage featuring a mini-game of a sliding tile game or a number selecting game. After completing the final stage for each girl, the player is shown an erotic scene for that girl and the player must wiggle the joystick left and right to advance the scene.

You can only control one tank at a time, you can move them around and blast your opponents tanks (getting the active one is usually a good idea). When you get blasted, your tank vanishes, and you must move a little blip over to another tank to resume play (this blip is invisible unless it is against a wall). You can also leave your tank and head for another one by pressing the second button. This is just a great strategic title, it holds up even today.

Once the match starts properly, Power and Direction meters will appear and players must use both their judgement and timing to select and execute the desired bowl. Timing is key as players are only allowed twenty seconds to make each shot.

The 'Strike 90' mode awards players ninety points for a strike and sixty points for a spare. In the 'Flash' game mode, the points flash across the lane as the players throw the ball. Should they succeed in knocking down the standing pins, the points that are displayed at the time the pins are struck will be added to the players' scores."

The enemy bases can also detach from the planet, turn into satellites, and orbit the planet while shooting missiles. Once all missile bases are destroyed, the player moves onto the next level. At higher levels, there is the white master base. It is very intelligent, and it can change the direction or speed of the planet rotation to avoid getting hit."
2079;liblrabl;liblrabl;"Libble Rabble (c) 1983 Namco.
";"At first glance, the gameplay resembles Taito's Qix. The player controls two ""arrows"", one red (Libble) and one blue (Rabble) with a line strung between them. The object is to wrap the line around poles and surround Mushlins and enemies with it. The player can either close the loops themselves (worth more points for the Mushlins) or move both arrows to the same edge of the screen. The player clears a ""season"" when he or she harvests all the Mushlins.

Along the way, various enemies will appear and try to stop the player. The most common are four little hooded critters (Hobblins), which start each season in the corners. If the player catches them in a loop, they will be sent to the top of the screen for a short period of time. Other critters such as fireballs (Killers), sparks (Changers), and Demons will also appear. These can be killed by closing a loop around them. Sometimes, scissors-like enemies (Shears) appear, and if they cross the player's line, they cut it. If the player's line is ever cut by Shears or Demons, a new one is instantly made: directly between the two arrows.

Every so often when the player closes a line, a detector goes off indicating that the area that has been closed off has a treasure chest somewhere. To actually uncover the chest, the player must surround a small enough area which covers just the chest, and no other possible hiding places. The game guides the player along that step, first by challenging them to uncover a chest at the start of the game (and then by revealing the locations of the chests for the first two seasons). When the player actually uncovers a chest, six bonus creatures (Topcups) will pop out, then make for the edges. The player must corral them with the line and then close the loop to score the bonus for them: they mean bonus letters. If the player manages to complete a bonus word, the season is automatically cleared out and the player moves to a bonus stage where they must try to uncover and collect chests (to collect a chest, the player needs to close a loop around an opened chest) within a time limit.

The player loses a life if any of the assorted critters touch one of the arrows or if he or she runs out of time (the border is the player's timer, and he or she can boost the time by looping Mushlins and plants), and the player gains an extra life at 40,000, 120,000, 200,000, 400,000, 600,000 and 1,000,000 points by default. After the 100th season, the season counter will stop at 99, similar to how Namco's Galaxian and King & Balloon's round indicators would stop after 48 rounds."

2090;llander;llander;"Lunar Lander (c) 1979 Atari.
";"Lunar Lander is a 1-player coin-op electronic game that simulates landing a manned spaceship on the moon. Various video-display phrases indicate score, time elapsed during this landing mission, fuel units consumed, altitude above the moon, and horizontal and vertical speed. The fuel consumption and both speed readings are important for the player to determine how to land the craft. Realistic engine rumble and crash sounds accompany game play. A high beep warns of an almost-depleted fuel supply, whereupon players can add coins to automatically extend the game and 'fill up' their fuel tanks. Depending on the quality of the landing or the crash, various messages are displayed on the screen.

Game play begins with engine rumble and the lander drifting towards the bottom
right corner of the screen. Horizontal and vertical speeds are constantly displayed, including two arrows to show horizontal and vertical directions of travel. Altitude is measured in distance above the surface of the mountain - not above 'sea level'. The screen also shows time in actual seconds, representing time elapsed in the current mission.

The operator can select from four different settings for fuel units - 450, 600, 750 or 900 fuel units per coin (free play is also available). As the lander module flies over the landscape, it approaches the mountains and a landing site. At a certain point near the mountains, the game 'zooms in' for a close-up view of everything on the screen.

If the player realizes the speed is too fast and the landing looks hopeless, he or she can press the ABORT button on the control panel. This will give the lander extra thrust and make it fly upwards at top speed. The abort feature does consume 120 to 180 fuel units, though, as a disincentive to overusing it. If the ABORT button is pressed too late, however, a crash cannot be avoided.

The four levels of mission difficulty are determined by the player and can be changed at any time during the game or the ready-to-play mode. The differences between the four are printed on the mission select panels and are self explanatory, except perhaps rotational momentum. This feature causes the lander to tumble around when either ROTATE button is pushed. The longer either button is held down, the faster the lander module will spin in that direction. The player gains control of the lander by pressing the other ROTATE button for the same amount of time."

2152;maglord;maglord;"Magician Lord (c) 1990 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited.
";"Magician Lord is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which players take on the roll of a wizard called Elta - the last Magician Lord - on his quest to save his homeland from the evil Gul-Agieze, who plans to resurrect the God of Destruction using 8 tomes of mystical power.

Elta has to jump, shoot and climb his way to the end of each of the game's 8 levels where he must beat a servant of Gal, along with one of Gal's sinister boss creations. To complete the game Elta must reach the final stage and defeat Az Atorse himself. If the player takes too long to complete a stage, Elta will be harassed by an invincible monster.

Elta's primary form of attack is a weak but fast-moving energy projectile that can fired in one of four directions, but by collecting the special coloured orbs that ocassionally appear, he can transform into a different form, making him more powerful and giving him new attacks.

These are the six different forms that Elta can assume by picking up the colored orbs:

* Dragon Warrior: In this form Elta attacks by breathing fire; a continuous short-range attack that, unlike the standad attack, can also be aimed diagonally.

* Waterman: The Waterman-form attacks with water grenades – blue bubbles of water that burst upon touching the ground and form into water pillars. The attack can hit several times for additional damage but only covers a small area.

* Poseidon: A more powerful version of the Waterman, Poseidon shoots wide waves of water that travel along the ground for several hits. It does severe damage and causes enemies to freeze and shatter on impact. While very powerful, this form moves very slowly.

* Shinobi: The Shinobi-form gains increased agility and attacks with powerful magical arcs of fire which are wide but slow-moving.

* Samurai: While limited in range, the Samurai-form is the only form that can attack through walls, shields or even multiple enemies, using a boomerang-like energy attack that does heavy damage.

* Raijin: The Raijin-form gives Elta's jumping ability a big boost as well as a unique attack that creates a continuous electrical field around his body."

";"Mag Max is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up in which a single player takes control of the 'Maxcraft' hover-ship and must battle their way through an packed enemy installation to find and destroy the invading alien 'Dragonia' fleet.

The action takes place both above and below ground and transporters appear throughout the game that allows the Maxcraft warp between the two as players search for the three-headed 'Dragonship'.

At various points the player will come across robot components - either a torso, a pair of legs or a plasma gun - and collecting these will eventually see the player's hover-ship become a towering robot, vastly increasing its firepower in the process.

If the Maxcraft takes an enemy hit when additional components are attached, a component is lost. If the ship is hit when only in basic form, however, a life is lost."

2167;majest12;majest12j;"Majestic Twelve - The Space Invaders Part IV (c) 1990 Taito Corp.
";"The third sequel to Taito's seminal ""Space Invaders"", Majestic Twelve leaves the classic Invaders game-play intact, but adds a slew of new alien invaders and power-ups to the mix. This, together with the vastly improved graphics that introduce colorful new backdrops - some of which scroll vertically in a similar fashion to the star-field in Namco's ""Galaxian"" - ensure that Majestic 12 is a worthy sequel to the legendary original.

The original game's flying saucer still makes an appearance, but instead of merely awarding bonus points when shot - as in the original game - it now drops a power-up pod for the player to retrieve. Power-ups include shield, faster shots, a laser (activated with the second button) and a giant butterfly, which freezes the invaders for a limited time.

One of the game's most memorable features was the 'Cattle Mutilation' bonus screen, in which the player must protect a heard of cattle from a number of fast-moving saucers, intent on stealing the animals. If a cow is snatched; the player must shoot the relevant saucer to free it; being careful not to actually shoot the cow itself. The '91 incarnation also introduced 'bosses' to the series for the first time; giant, screen-filling aliens that required several shots to kill.

Another major difference to the previous games in the series is that if an invader reaches the bottom of the screen, the player will simply lose a ship (in the original, the game would end once an alien had landed). Also, the player's ship now comes equipped with a shield that can withstand several hits. The shield's strength is depleted every time it takes a direct hit from one of the invaders, and too many hits will result in the shield disappearing altogether. A direct hit on an un-shielded ship will result in the loss of a player life."

2187;mappyj;mappyj;"Mappy (c) 1983 Namco. 
";"You are Mappy, the brave mouse policeman. Mappy's mission is to retrieve all of the stolen treasure from the Mewkies cat gang. They've stashed all of the loot in their leader's mansion which contains several floors, and numerous trampolines that the Mewkies like to use to travel between stories. Mappy must keep away from the cats and collect all items in the house before moving on to the next house. If Mappy is caught by a cat, he loses a life. Mappy also loses a life if he crashes to the floor by breaking through a trampoline or falling into a pitfall. When all of Mappy's lives are lost, the game is over. 

Houses have six floors, and some houses in later rounds have an attic. Mappy gets to the different floors by jumping on a trampoline. Mappy can jump three times on a trampoline, but the fourth time will break it. Once Mappy moves onto a floor, he can jump on the trampoline another three times. 

When Mappy jumps on the trampoline, he will go to the top floor of the house unless you push the joystick left or right to move him onto a particular floor. You can move Mappy onto a floor as he's on the way up, but not on the way down. 

Nyamco, the boss cat, does not chase Mappy. Instead he moves around in a zigzag pattern. He also like to hide for a few seconds behind a treasure. 

The cats are very sneaky and, if given half a chance, will try to corner Mappy at the end of one of the platforms or to trap him on one of the floors he must use to get to the treasures he's after. 

The cats have no defense mechanisms of any kind. But they cannot be permanently eliminated either. As soon as Mappy puts one cat out of commission, another cat appears somewhere else in the house. 

However, in an emergency, you can slow one cat down for short periods of time. This is accomplished by having Mappy throw open a standard door in the cat's face to knock him down and stun him. When hit by the door, the cat will be stunned for several seconds. When he is disabled like this, Mappy can walk right by him and not get caught. To temporarily eliminate more than one pursuer at a time, Mappy must catch them in the microwaves emitted when opening power doors - the thick flashing doors that flicker with different colors. 

As your skill level increases, the number and direction of pursuers coming at you at any one time and the speed with which they move, is gradually increased; plus, their pursuit patterns become more and more devious while their overall accuracy is highly improved. 

Bonus lives are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values ('Extra Lives' dip switch). 

Once all the treasure in the house has been retrieved, you move on to the next house. 

A bonus round is awarded to you after the 2nd house, and after every 3rd house thereafter, i.e. in after the 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, etc. houses. In the bonus rounds, you score extra points by popping balloons. Using the trampoline, jump to pop as many balloons as possible in the fewest number of moves. The bonus round ends when the music ends. If you die during a bonus round, the bonus round ends there, but the number of lives remaining is not affected. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

Mappy (""Micro Police"") - This is you, our hero and defender of justice, the police-mouse who is on the case to recover the stolen loot from the enemy cats. 

Nyamco (""Boss The Big Bit"") - Does not chase Mappy, but moves around the house in a zig-zag fashion 

Mewkies (""Naughty Folks"") - This gang of smaller cats chases and tries to catch Mappy. 

Gosenzo - This appears when Mappy moves throughout the house for a long period of time without retrieving any stolen items. Once it appears, Mappy has no chance of escaping. 

Doors - When Mappy is directly in front of a door, press the Door button to open the door. Doors open in the direction of the doorknob. Mappy cannot go through a closed door; you must open it to go through. 

Power Doors - These flicker with different colors and are thicker than the ordinary doors. When you press the Door button, the door opens and sends a microwave that flushes away Mappy's feline pursuers. There are four power doors in each house."

Each POW can only be used a maximum of three times. 

As well as the game's enemies, players are also hampered by the huge amount of inertia that comes into play when controlling Mario or Luigi. This is due to the low degree of traction that exists between the Mario brothers and the platforms. On later phases, ice appears on the platforms reducing the amount of traction even further.

";Each player (up to 2 people may play at a time, 2-player mode is more fun), controls a little geometric shape. Each player starts at opposite sides of the maze. The object is to get to the point where the other player started, before they get to where you started. You use a joystick to guide your 'character' through the maze. The game is time based, and you score a point for each maze you beat faster than your opponent (or the computer player if you are going solo). The factory setting is for a 90 second game, but this is operator adjustable. The graphics are done in monochrome white on black. With no detail on anything. The maze walls are only a pixel thick, while the characters themselves (simple shapes), are not much bigger. The mazes are not stylized in anyway. They look exactly like the kind of maze you would do with a paper and pen.
2221;mazerbla;mazerbla;"Mazer Blazer (c) 1983 Stern Electronics.
";"The object of the game is to prevent the attacking aliens from working through the maze and entering your ship. Each time an alien enters your ship, you lose a life.

There are 14 different types of aliens in Mazer Blazer. Each level will have 1 or 2 different types of aliens that present the player with constantly changing levels of difficulty. The screen is divided into 4 colors. The colors determine the point value of the object (see Scoring section for more details).

Shoot the aliens using the rapid fire Mazer Blaster. The farther from the ship you shoot the aliens, the higher the poin value awarded.

The walls of the maze are in 2 different colors; grey and orange. Orange walls are indestructible, while the grey walls can be shot away either by the nasties on the screen or your Mazer Blaster. Shooting the grey walls leaves gaps in the maze ans makes it easier for the aliens to reach their ship, and lowers your wall bonus.

After each level is a Timed Bonus Rack. There are 8 aliens per bonus rack.. Shoot the aliens as fast as possible for a maximum bonus. The aliens seen in the bonus rack will be the alien encountered in the next maze level.

In every maze is the freeze target (located at the lower center of the screen). The freeze target, when hit, momentarily stops the movement of the aliens on the screen."

2224;mbomberj;mbomberj;"Muscle Bomber - The Body Explosion (c) 1993 Capcom.
";"A 1-on-1 fighting game in which players choose from 10 different wrestlers and take to the ring to try and defeat their larger-than-life opponents. Each wrestler has an assortment of moves, including his own special 'super slam'. The object of the game is to win and defend the championship by pinning or putting a submission hold on your opponent.

There are 2 different game modes to select and play : Single Match or Tag Team 'Battle Royal'. In Single Match, players choose to be one of eight wrestlers including 'Mike Hagger', 'Alexander The Grater', 'El Stingray', 'King Rasta Mon', 'Titanic Tim', 'Gunloc', 'Biff Bolshevik' and 'The Great Oni' ('Jumbo Jack' and 'The Scorpion' cannot be selected in this game).

Once a wrestler has been selected, players will compete in a world-wide tournament against the other 9 wrestlers (including 'Jumbo Jack' and 'The Scorpion') in respective matches. In each match, players must defeat each of their respective opponents by a pinfall, count-out or submission in order to proceed to each of the following matches. Once all opponents are defeated, the winner will be crowned champion and players will have to face all opponents again to defend their title.

In Tag Team 'Battle Royal', players can choose to play as any 2 of the 10 wrestlers for their tag team, including 'Jumbo Jack' and 'The Scorpion'. Here, the player and his or her partner have to eliminate both of the 2 wrestlers on the opposing tag team, in order to win the match and proceed to the next. During these matches, if the player is eliminated before his or her partner is, the match will be declared no contest and it will be a draw.

During each bout in this game, metal buckets and/or glass bottles will sometimes be thrown into the ring which can be picked by the players' wrestler(s) and used as weapons against their opponents."

";"SINGLE PLAYER GAME

The game-play sequence in MEGATACK consists of 4 or 5 turns (operator selectable) each of which lasts as long as the player can skilfully maneuver his spacepod to avoid destruction. When he loses a spacepod, the GIP message reappears, accompanied by the GIP sound, and displays the number of spacepods left. After the last spacepod is destroyed, the game-over sound is heard and the game-over message is displayed.

Assuming a (4) pod game, play begins with player-scores (00000) and at the top and the (3) best scores displayed across the bottom Eight (8) monsters appear in the upper portion of the screen and move towards the bottom, while dropping their bombs. The player uses his joystick control to move his spacepod across the bottom of the screen. The spacepod will start with the number (4) in the center and the number will decrease each time a spacepod is destroyed so that the number (1) will be in the center on the last round.

As the spacepod is moved across the bottom of the screen the player fires his laser energy-beams towards the left, right, and straight-up accompanied by an echoing laser sound effect. The laser beams have unlimited range, covering the entire play-field, and each spacepod has an unlimited number of shots. The (3) laser beams are fired simultaneously. Each fire-button must be released and pressed again to fire a second shot. Also, there is a slight ""reload"" delay so that beams cannot-be fired too rapidly.

Whenever a laser beam strikes a monster or a bomb, it explodes with a visual flash and an audio blast. If a monster is blasted, the player is awarded a 'kill' and his score is increased by the appropriate score (per the scoring menu when a bomb is blasted, no points are scored.  

When a spacepod is hit by a bomb, it explodes with a growing flash and a reverberating blast. When the spacepod gets too close to a monster, the monster jumps up and sporadically devours it while growling and burping, if a monster reaches the bottom, it bounces across the bottom in an attempt to devour the spacepod.

When all the monsters in a given round have been destroyed the screen will turn into a starfield, and small space rings will appear, which if not shot at, hit, and destroyed will grow in size. If any one (1) ring is allowed to reach a predetermined size, it will de-activate the spacepods laser gun, which during these rounds only fires straight up, lift the spacepod off the bottom of the screen, absorb it and then disappear (shrinking in size), thus ending the round. The next round begins with the next wave of monsters. This starfield round occurs between every wave of monsters, and if the player is successful in destroying all the rings the next wave of monsters will then appear.

When the spacepod is finally destroyed either by being absorbed, hit by a bomb or devoured by a monster the round is over and the video image returns to the GIP display flashing player (1) up and displaying the remaining spacepods the screen then goes black again and this time the pod with the number (3) in the center appears at the bottom of the screen and play continues as before.

During play there are always (8) monsters (max) on the screen, however the monsters attack in waves of 25, after each multiple of 25 kills the starfield or space ring round will appear with each ring worth the same score as the monsters were worth in the previous screen display. The monsters that reappear after each space ring round are a new shape, and color and score more points, and drop a different color bomb, any monsters left at the end of a round will reappear at the beginning of the next round. At the beginning of the game the action is rather moderate to allow new players an opportunity to develop a 'feel' for the game. In each succeeding wave of monsters, the bombs begin to fall at an increased rate and the monsters motions are increased.

All of these features combine to make MEGATACK satisfying for the novice, challenging for the expert, and profitable for the operator.

TWO-PLAYER MODE

The play of MEGATACK in a two-player game is identical to single-play with the players alternating turns. On the Upright Version, the players use one common set of controls. On the cocktail version there are two sets of controls on opposite sides of the table. The computer activates control alternately between player 1 and 2 and flip-flops the screen image so that it is oriented to the player in control.

The GIP message, which appears after each turn, clearly indicates which player is up by flashing it in the player's color. This also allows time for the players to position themselves at the controls, but is brief enough to avoid unnecessary ""dead-time"". The use of two different player-colors eliminates any confusion as to which player is in control."

";"Earth is under attack from an alien race from the 'Nemesis' region of space, and human civilisation now stands on the brink of collapse. The invaders have utilised energy molecules - known to earth scientists as 'Newalones' - to create powerful beam weapons with which to attack Earth. In response, Earth's scientists have developed the 'Black Fly' project; a powerful space craft that utilises the same Newalone molecule technology of the alien aggressors.

Metal Black is a very playable sideways scrolling shoot-em-up which manages to feel different to other games in the genre, due to the fact that it lacks a a player-definable weapon power-up system. Instead of collecting items that provide extra speed, different weapons etc. players must collect the clusters of 'Newalone' molecules that float around each level. These molecule clusters will gradually increase the player ship's firepower.

As long as the Metal Black ship has sufficient firepower, players can activate the 'Beam Weapon', which generates a powerful energy beam that destroys everything it comes into contact with. The Beam Weapon will only last for a few seconds and its use will reduce the ship's energy levels. Once the Beam weapon de-activates, Metal Black will have vastly reduced firepower for its forward-firing laser cannon. Players must once again collect the Newalone molecule clusters to build up the ship's firepower."

2277;mia;mia;"M.I.A. - Missing in Action (c) 1989 Konami.
";"M.I.A. is a direct sequel to 1985's 'Green Beret' and, like it's predecessor, is a horizontally scrolling jump and shoot game for one or two players. Special forces soldiers must penetrate several enemy-packed combat zones to reach a POW compound. 

Upon reaching the compound, the player must infiltrate and rescue the POWs held there, before escorting them safely through a final enemy-packed level to the rescue helicopter that awaits at the end. 

Unlike 'Green Beret', the two-player game in M.I.A. sees both players fighting side-by-side, instead of the alternate approach of the original game. 

The game consists of six stages; 

* War-torn battlefield 
* Airstrip 
* Jungle 
* Rail Yard 
* PoW Base 
* Escort the PoW's to the Helicopter 

The first four stages are presented in random order and may also be ""mirrored"", so players battle right-to-left instead of left-to-right. This vastly increases variety to the game and adds replay value. The PoW and helicopter stages are always the last two stages. At the end of each level, the players must fight off a flurry of enemy troops and destroy gun emplacements and watch towers. Certain sections of each stage offer players a different route, with both platforms and underground tunnels that can be utilized and explored. 

As with 'Green Beret', players start each level carrying only a combat knife. Specific enemy troops carry weapons which are dropped when the soldier is killed and can be picked up by the players. The weapons are always carried by soldiers wearing red uniforms, and range from an assault rifle, grenades, a flame-thrower or a bazooka. Players can carry more than one weapon and can cycle through them as needed. Each collected weapon has only a limited supply of shots. 

After rescuing the PoW's on the sixth stage, players must escort as many of the escapees as possible to a waiting helicopter, and must get at least one PoW safely aboard the chopper to complete the mission and start a new set of stages."

2279;miaj;miaj;"M.I.A. - Missing in Action (c) 1989 Konami.
";"M.I.A. is a direct sequel to 1985's 'Green Beret' and, like it's predecessor, is a horizontally scrolling jump and shoot game for one or two players. Special forces soldiers must penetrate several enemy-packed combat zones to reach a POW compound. 

Upon reaching the compound, the player must infiltrate and rescue the POWs held there, before escorting them safely through a final enemy-packed level to the rescue helicopter that awaits at the end. 

Unlike 'Green Beret', the two-player game in M.I.A. sees both players fighting side-by-side, instead of the alternate approach of the original game. 

The game consists of six stages; 

* War-torn battlefield 
* Airstrip 
* Jungle 
* Rail Yard 
* PoW Base 
* Escort the PoW's to the Helicopter 

The first four stages are presented in random order and may also be ""mirrored"", so players battle right-to-left instead of left-to-right. This vastly increases variety to the game and adds replay value. The PoW and helicopter stages are always the last two stages. At the end of each level, the players must fight off a flurry of enemy troops and destroy gun emplacements and watch towers. Certain sections of each stage offer players a different route, with both platforms and underground tunnels that can be utilized and explored. 

As with 'Green Beret', players start each level carrying only a combat knife. Specific enemy troops carry weapons which are dropped when the soldier is killed and can be picked up by the players.

";"- TRIVIA -

High School Graffitti Miki is an alternate version of the Konami game ""Mikie"". Aside from the noticeably different decor in the homeroom (all right, it's only the blackboard), there are several MAJOR differences in this MUCH harder version. Hearts that were normally in glass cases are stacked as piles of three hearts (you only have to time the last heart for Perfects). Furthermore, you can't headbutt in this version, you have to yell, which temporarily stuns enemies EXCEPT FOR your homeroom teacher, who cannot be stopped except by thrown items. Yelling is also much shorter range than headbutting, making timing crucial. Not a version for the weak-reflexed. Most importantly though is that if you take too long in a room, the Classroom teacher can throw what looks like either a necklace or dentures at you. On the plus side, you recover faster from a yell than a headbutt (less lag time) and enemies don't speed up as fast as they do in the other romsets (unfortunately, it seems as though the homeroom teacher will speed up on his own in this romset)."

2289;milliped;milliped;"Millipede (c) 1982 Atari.
";"Millipede is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster-scan video display. The game action takes place on a playfield filled with mushrooms, flowers, and deadly DDT bombs. The player tries to destroy a variety of insects that drop from the top of the screen or enter from the sides of the screen, most of them to attack the player. The player controls a bow-shaped vehicle called the Archer. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy as many objects as possible for a high point score, before the player's lives are all used up.

Player control consists of a Midi Trak-Ball control and a FIRE button. The Archer is moved by rotating the Midi Trak-Ball control. The Archer can be moved in all directions, but only within the bottom fifth of the screen. However, the Archer must move around mushrooms, flowers, and DDT bombs, since these are fixed and not 'transparent' objects. Pressing the FIRE button causes the Archer to emit an arrow that travels upward. The Archer may fire one or many arrows (by holding down the FIRE button constantly). But only one arrow will appear on the screen at a time.

A player may start a game at an advanced level of play and receive bonus points for starting play at that level.

Game play begins with a playfield of randomly placed mushrooms and DDT bombs. A Millipede enters at the top center of the screen and starts snaking its way across the screen. The Millipede changes direction when it runs into a fixed object in the playfield (mushroom, DDT bomb, or flower), or when it reaches the side boundaries of the playfield.

When a segment of the Millipede is shot, it is destroyed and a mushroom appears where that segment was shot. When shot, the Millipede breaks into two smaller Millipedes, each with its own head. When a Millipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it starts back up, but remains within the area of the Archer (the bottom 5th of the screen).

If a Millipede reaches the bottom of the screen without being shot, it releases its tail. This tail changes into a new head. Also to provide the player a challenge, if a Millipede is still alive when it reaches the bottom, new heads will enter the screen almost at the bottom of the sides. More of these heads will appear as time progresses.

An attack wave is complete when all Millipede segments are destroyed. The screen then scrolls down one line. At the 9th attack wave, when the Millipede with only four segments enters from the top of the screen, the screen will scroll down every two seconds. The only way a player can stop the scrolling screen is to shoot a DDT bomb or destroy the entire Millipede. 

It takes four shots to destroy a mushroom. After the fourth attack wave of each wave cycle, the entire playfield of mushrooms changes. Some mushrooms die and new mushrooms grow where there were none before. A mushroom next to a DDT bomb becomes poisoned (See Tips and Tricks below for complete details).

When a Millipede runs into a poisoned mushroom, two things happen: its head changes color, and it changes direction and falls vertically to the bottom of the screen.

DDT bombs explode when hit by an arrow. Any object near the bomb is engulfed by the explosion. Insects are worth three times their normal point value if they are destroyed by the explosion.

Spiders appear in any round. They move in a random pattern on the bottom third of the screen. As the player's score increases, the range of the Spider decreases, until it is confined to the bottom fifth of the screen. Also, more Spiders enter as the game progresses. A Spider destroys any mushroom or flower it moves over. Depending on a special option switch setting, the Spider moves slowly until a player reaches a specific score, and then it speeds up. If the Archer and a Spider collide, both are destroyed.

When a Millipede with fewer than eleven segments appears, an Earwig enters the screen from either side, moving at a relatively slow speed. As the player earns more points, the Earwig's speed increases. If an Earwig passes over a mushroom, it poisons the mushroom.

When a Millipede with fewer than ten segments appears, a Dragonfly enters at the top of the screen. The Dragonfly moves in a zig-zag pattern and its speed increases as the player's score increases. As the Dragonfly moves, it leaves a trail of mushrooms behind.

When a Millipede with fewer than nine segments appears, a Mosquito enters at the top of the screen and flies in a diagonal pattern. The Mosquito's speed increases as the player's score increases. When a Mosquito is destroyed, the screen scrolls up one row.

Beetles appear randomly after the first wave. They enter from the sides of the screen near the bottom, travel down to the bottom of the screen, and walk at least half way across the bottom. Then the Beetle travels up and exits at the side of the screen. If a Beetle passes over a mushroom, the mushroom changes into a flower. Flowers cannot be destroyed by the Archer's arrows. Depending on a dip switch setting, the number of Beetles appearing on the screen and the speed of the beetles increase as the player's score increases. When a Beetle is destroyed, the screen scrolls down one row.

Bees may fall from the top of the screen during any round. As the Bee falls, it leaves a trail of mushrooms behind. The Archer must hit a Bee twice to destroy it; the first shot just speeds it up.

An Inchworm may appear when a Millipede with fewer that eleven segments appears. The Inchworm travels from one side of the screen to the other side. It moves slowly until the player's score reaches 80,000 points. Then it speeds up. If the Archer destroys the Inchworm, all insects will slow down for about three and one-half seconds.

After a Millipede of one, three, five, seven, or eleven segments has been destroyed, an insect bombing raid occurs. A raid may have only Bees, Dragonflies, Mosquitoes, or a mixture of all three."

";"A horizontal tank shooter game, with great atmosphere Parallax scrolling background.

The mid-day heat is rapidly becoming unbearable as the supply helicopter lowers your battle tank on to edge of the desert. You have a whole day's travelling ahead, 90 miles across the seemingly endless desert, until you reach the target of your mission - the enemy's desert fortress. Only after you have managed to destroy it, will it be safe for the transport helicopter to collect you and send you on another full-scale mission.

Unfortunately, the going across the desert is not easy. Your tank has run out of super-missiles and you must replenish your armoury from the stockpiles on the way. If you don't collect enough you will not be able to destroy the forts and the enemy base, which is so well protected you need three missile hits to put it out of action. However, you have unlimited supplies of shells for your heavy duty gun that can fire in all directions.

To add to your diffículties, the enemy have buried deadly mines all over the desert floor which you must avoid at all costs, or lose a tank. Once you are on your way, the enemy, knowing of your mission, keep sending all manner of war machines to try and stop your journey. You must take action against them all, and avoid their bombs. After 60 miles of hazardous travel night arrives, and the enemy use this opportunity to try and confuse you by sending a varied mixture of attackers under cover of darkness, Beware, some of them are robot controlled and will try and crash into your tank.

Good luck in your mission-the reward is high. A spare tank every 30.000 points and a chance to record our initials on the tank coomander's roll of honour."
2296;mineswpr;mineswpr;"Minesweeper (c) 1977 Amutech.
";"This game was two player only, you must have a real live person to play against, or else the other players boat will head directly for the bottom wall, which doesn't make for a very interesting game. Each player moves their little boat around leaving a solid line of mines behind them. All moves are made on an invisible grid, so you can only turn at 90 degree angles. To win you must last longer than your opponent before hitting something (first person to hit something loses). One good strategy is to try and box your opponent in to a small section of the screen, and then just move carefully until they crash. Pushing backwards on the stick will cause you to crash into your own mines, so avoid that at all cost.

The game was controlled with buttons rather than joysticks (this was cheaper to produce, and most of the other similar games of the time used buttons as well). Inserting a coin started the game at once. Both players got to play for a single coin. The game ended after one player chalked up six wins, but this was operator adjustable down to as low as three. The operator can also turn the sound on and off with internal switches as well."

The player takes on the role of one of two yellow and green colored mice. Armed only with the ability to blow bubbles and jump, the objective is to trap and kill all of your enemies within the bubbles to advance to the next stage. The bubbles can also be used as temporary platforms, to help the mice reach previously inaccessible areas of a level. If a player is touched by an enemy then the player dies.

Any trapped enemies who are not killed quickly enough will turn red and escape their bubble prison. These angry enemies are much faster than before, making them harder to kill. Enemies also become angry if players are taking too long to complete a level. Defeated enemies are turned into bonus fruit items that can be collected for points.

On many levels, special bubbles appear such as water filled bubbles appear. These can be burst by players to release their contents and destroy enemies. The water bubble releases a torrent of water that will quickly flow down the platforms to the bottom of the screen. Any enemies caught in the flow are killed.

Bubbles containing letters also appear. The aim is to collect the letters needed to spell the word along the side of the screen.

2303;missile;missile2;"Missile Command (c) 1980 Atari.
";"Missile Command is a 1- or 2-player game with a color monitor. The game depicts an Armageddon-style war in which players defend their missile bases and cities with antiballistic missiles (ABMs). The enemy - the game computer - launches incoming waves of attack missiles. These weapons may be either individual missiles or multiple independently-targed re-entry vehicles (MIRV), which unleash branching attack missiles. In addition, the enemy occasionally launches missiles from a fast-moving 'killer' satellite or from bombers. The enemy also launches smart bombs that usually avoid explosions. 

Players receive varying numbers of points for intercepting attack missiles, for having unused ABMs still in their bases' arsenals, and for having their cities undamaged after a missile wave. 

The game begins when either Start pushbutton is pressed. The game ends when the player's last city is destroyed. 

The three bases - Alpha, Delta and Omega - each have ten ABMs ready to be fired. Players must be careful to fire the ABMs more or less evenly from among those bases, because no more ABMs are granted until the screen resets in preparation for a new wave of attack missiles. If an enemy missile strikes a city or base, the colorful buildings or base will change to the solid color of the landscape. 

The game continues until all cities are destroyed. Missile Command has no operator-selectable fixed time length. Thus a highly skilled player can play longer than the novice. 

During the second wave, a 'killer' satellite and/or bomber will appear on the screen, moving quickly and launching attack missiles at the bases and cities. Players get bonus points for shooting down the satellites or bombers. 

The general approach for getting high point scores is fairly quickly discovered : try to launch your ABMs when the enemy missiles have just appeared at the top of the screen. Then they are clustered together, where one ABM can usually destroy several enemy missiles. In the later, more advanced waves, players can lay out a blanket of explosions. 

You start the game with a certain number of cities depending on the 'Cities' dip switch (4, 5, 6, or 7 cities; the default is 6), and can have no more than 6 cities in play at one time. If the dip switch is set to starting with 7 cities, the 7th city will be treated as a bonus city after at least one city in play has been destroyed. 

You earn a bonus city every time you score a certain number of points ('Bonus City' dip switch, the default is 10000). You don't see your bonus cities until they replace destroyed cities at the beginning of the next wave.

Anti-Ballistic Missiles (ABMs) : The defensive missiles you launch to protect your cities. Each missile base contains 10 ABMs per wave. If any missile base is struck by an attack missile or smart bomb, the remaining stock of ABMs for that wave are destroyed, and the missile base is rendered useless until the next wave. You receive bonus points for every ABM you have remaining at the end of each wave. 

Targeting crosshair : Aim your ABMs quickly but carefully. Use the trackball to move the targeting crosshair to where you want the next ABM to go, then press any Launch Control button to fire the ABM. The ABM will explode where the crosshair was positioned when the Launch Control button was pressed. 

Cities : There are six cities in total on the screen at one time, three on either side of the Delta Base. If one enemy missile or smart bomb manages to strike a city, that city will be wiped out. When all cities are destroyed, the game is over. 

Alpha Base : The missile base on the bottom left corner of the screen. Press the leftmost Launch Control button to launch an ABM from the Alpha base.

NOTE: The Alpha and Omega bases launch ABMs at a slower speed than the Delta base, so you must plan further ahead when launching ABMs from those bases. 

Attack Missiles : Their only aim is to destroy your cities and missile bases. Every missile wave starts off with a hailstorm of attack missiles. They never deviate from their path. They may, however, turn into MIRVs. 

MIRV : Surprise! There is no warning when an attack missile turns into an MIRV (with multiple warheads). Think fast. Each new missile that the MIRV unleashes is carefully targeted.

Bomber : A big slow-moving target that flies across the sky at a mid-level altitude, but watch out! It fires attack missiles. First appears in Wave 2. 

WARNING: If you destory a bomber or killer satellite before they deploy their attack missiles, you may see their attack missiles added to the downpour. An existing attack missile may also turn into an MIRV. 

Smart Bomb : Smart enough to avoid most explosion clouds from your ABMs. Your ABM must explode next to one in order to destroy it. You can also squeen it between two explosions to destroy it. First appears in Wave 5.

Mizubaku Daibouken is a cute and colourful single-player scrolling platform game from the same stable that brought the classics ""Bubble Bobble"", ""The New Zealand Story"" and ""Rainbow Islands"" to the gaming world.

The game features 'Hipopo the Hippo'; a strange Platypus-Hippopotamus hybrid who must fight his way through a large number of enemy-packed levels in search of his missing girlfriend - rescuing other Hippo-like creatures that await trapped at the end of each level.

Hipopo is armed with magical water globes that can be thrown at enemies to trap them. Once trapped, the enemies can then be kicked to kill them. Enemies left unkicked will soon free themselves and return to their pursuit of Hipopo. Holding down the fire button increases the size of the globes and power-ups can also be picked-up that increases the globe size further still.

The level design makes full use of the game's water-based theme, with moving platforms, collapsible floors, boats and water-wheels all making an appearance. Small plants also appear on certain levels that can be ""watered"", causing them to grow and form new platforms. Some plants are hidden and only appear when an area is watered. These usually contain doors to secret rooms and areas.

At the end of every 2nd or 3rd stage, Hipopo must defeat a large end-of-level guardian. Once the guardian has been defeated, two doors will appear, allowing players to choose which route they wish to take next."

Throughout the course of the matches the player gains energy as shown by fire icons on the right hand side of the screen. When the player is 'fired up' he has better luck in the hands he is dealt so it is possible to make better winning hands. Even so, each girl has unlimited betting funds so the player must defeat each one three times, no matter how good of a hand the player has.

Each girl features two mandatory strip sequences, and the player gets to choose one of four options for the final strip sequence.

The player can lose a match and still continue right where he left off so long as he still has betting funds remaining.  But if his betting funds are depleted then the game is over."

";"Mortal Kombat II is a direct sequel to the 1992 original featuring new fighters (increasing the character roster from 7 to 12) and improved graphics. 

As with its predecessor, MKII's matches are divided into rounds, with victory awarded to the first player to win two rounds. At the point of defeat, the losing fighter will become dazed and the winner is given the opportunity to execute a 'finishing move'. 

Some of the standard fighting moves (moves shared by all characters) have now been expanded or enhanced. A crouching punch has been added and the 'roundhouse kick' is more powerful and now knocks opponents across the screen. Also, the difference in hit boxes between high and low kicks is now more marked. 

Additionally, returning characters gain new special moves and MKII marks the first appearence of multiple Fatalities - as well as additional, non-lethal finishing moves - in the series. In addition to the Fatalities of its predecessor, MKII offers 'Babalities' (turning a defeated opponent into a crying baby), 'Friendships' (a non-malicious interaction, such as dancing or giving a gift to the defeated opponent) and stage-specific Fatalities (the winner uppercutting their opponent into an abyss below, spikes above, or a pool of acid in the background). 

Each character still shares generic attributes - speed, power, jump height and airtime - albeit with differing hit boxes. The sequel drops the points system of its prequel in favour of a consecutive win tally."

";"A weird driving game with a car that has long arms that reach out to grab a variety of edible items that appear along roadside.

The object is to drive safely down the road. Pick up enough fuel to stay alive while avoiding other vehicles that go by, grab as many bonus objects as possible including apples, cherries, bananas, acorns, live fish and money, and park your car in the garage. Driving while trying to pick up the goodies is difficult and you can crash very easily on the narrow roads. The pace of the game is frustrating because the hands move slowly while the car itself moves really fast, especially in the later rounds. If one of your hands hits a tree or any other foreign object in its quest for food, the car winces in pain for a few moments until it can use its hands again.

You can get a bonus for putting used-up food into garbage cans. Grabbing fish which leap out of surrounding rivers is a safe bet, but most other bonuses are placed, so you can crash if you try to grab them. The best strategy is only to go for the fuel, since the car is a big gas guzzler and you can also get a bonus for leftover fuel at the end of the drive."

DRACULA'S HOUSE
The player-hero of the game is LITTLE RED, a wily, red-headed boy who chases Dracula throughout his five-story haunted house. Up and down staircases and through Warp Doors leading to secret passageways, Little Red zaps defending bats while attempting to light candles in certain rooms. When a candle is lit a Magic Sword is energized with mystical powers. Little Red must touch the flashing Magic Sword to gain SuperZap power... only a SuperZap will defeat the sly Dracula.

FRANKENSTEIN'S CASTLE
Little Red enters the eerie castle of the hulking Frankenstein. He pursues Frankenstein around his six-story castle while avoiding the fierce Wolfmen.  The tricky Wolfmen can be zapped, but be careful, they can duck under the zap and attack Little Red. Fewer candles are now available to be lit. Warp doors to secret passageways can be used only when they flash. Special jump-down zones allow Little Red to jump down several levels at once, eliminating any Wolfmen in the way as he descends, but Frankenstein can only be defeated with a SuperZap.

CHAMELEON MAN'S GRAVEYARD
The greatest challenge yet... to dispatch the sneaky Chameleon Man and his horde of Spiders.  Entering the spooky graveyard, Little Red finds that only one candle is available for lighting which is found in a crypt guarded by giant Spiders. Chameleon Man changes his color to match that of the background and thus becomes invisible. Little Red must pass over one of the Color-Change Spots to change the background color making Chameleon Man visible again. Chameleon Man can do away with Little Red with a flick of his long tongue. Chameleon Man can only be done in with a SuperZap."

";"Moon Cresta is a 1 or 2-player game in which players may compete for highest score against the game computer. Each time a player is hit by an alien, the game switches to his opponent's sequence.

The object is to destroy as many of the descending aliens as possible. To accomplish this the player is given a three stage multi-fire Warship. He begins with the first stage, firing a single laser at the enemy. If he is successful in eliminating the first 4 sets of aliens, he is given an opportunity to dock his first stage onto the second within a specific time limit (the sooner he unites the stages, the higher is his awarded score).

Once docked, the stages combine their firing power, so the first (1 laser) adds to the second (2 lasers) giving the player a total of 3 usable lasers as the game continues.

The player then must face 2 more sets of aliens and a shower of meteors, after which he has a chance to dock again, this time uniting with the third stage for a combined fire power of five lasers. If he is able to defeat the last two sets of aliens intact, the entire sequence begins again. The game continues with increasing difficulty until the entire warship is destroyed. When the warship is hit the player continues with whatever stages remain. If his score reaches 30,000 he is awarded a free game and his score continues to accumulate."

";"The object of the game is to bump your enemies - space bugs - off the solar base using Motos, your ship. When you bump all of them off, you move to the next base or round. If Motos is knocked off the base, you lose one life. The game is over when you lose all your lives.

You can collect Power parts and Jump parts lying on the solar base by simply having Motos touch them. The collected parts will be displayed in the lower left corner of the screen and you can use them in the next round. Motos can be outfitted with no more than seven power parts; the more power parts added, the more powerful Motos is. However, Motos can only be outfitted with only one jump part per round. With a jump part, Motos can jump over two squares by moving the joystick in the desired direction and pressing the Jump button. One jump on a square cracks the square and a second jump in the same spot makes a hole in the solar base.

You can outfit Motos with these parts in the Power Parts or Jump Parts screen displayed at the beginning of each round. Select the number of parts you want by moving left and right with the joystick, and lock them in place by pressing the Jump button. You can use the selected parts for one round only; they will not be available in subsequent rounds.

Linger too long on the playing field and Shooting Stars will begin to fall periodically onto the solar base. The Stars are aimed at Motos, and when they miss they crack a square or break a hole in the solar base (like they do to the base behind the Motos logo in the attract mode's title sequence).

Tour mode is the standard mode of play featuring 57 stages. The player goes on a tour of the world, popping balloons and picking up power-ups. Each location on the tour features a number of stages which feature a new background of a famous tourist attraction. Each stage is cleared by popping all of the balloons within that stage.

Expert mode is a mode for advanced players.  Play is broken up into stages like in tour mode but the stages are much more difficult.

Panic mode is a basic one-stage mode of play where new balloons continuously fall from the sky. The single stage is a basic one with no platforms or barriers. Some of the smallest balloons will flash and shooting these balloons will pause all of the balloons in place for a short duration of time."

";"The player controls a moon buggy, viewing it from the side, that travels over the moon's surface. While driving it must avoid obstacles such as craters and mines. The buggy is also attacked by UFOs from above and tanks on the ground.

- CAST OF CHARACTERS -

PLAYER CHARACTER - MOON BUGGY : Your vehicle across the rugged lunar terrain is a specially designed moon buggy. It comes with six wheels on three specially mounted axles that contain especially absorbent shocks which allow the buggy to glide across the uneven landscape of the moon. The wheels of the buggy can be utilized to create short hops, which allow the buggy to jump over pits and other hazardous obstacles that can't be removed in time. It is also equipped with a roof mounted gun for anti-air fire and a forward mounted cannon. The anti-air gun can fire up to four bullets on the screen at one time, while the cannon can only project one bullet at a time. The buggy is destroyed by impact with an obstacle, getting hit by alien craft bombs, or falling into a lunar pit.

ENEMIES ON THE GROUND :
1) Craters and Rocks - Throughout the course of driving on the moon, you will encounter natural terrain obstacles that you must overcome. Nothing more can be done about craters than jumping over them. Most craters are spaced out, but a few come in rapid succession of one another, so jumps must be timed carefully. In addition to craters, you will come across rocks on the landscape. Most rocks are easily dispatched with one shot from your cannon. Sometimes, two rocks occur back to back. If you're fast enough, you can destroy them both. Otherwise, you may opt to jump over the pair. Small rocks lie below the height of your cannon fire. They can only be destroyed if the shot from your cannon detonates near the rock. Otherwise, the shot will sail harmlessly over the rock. When in doubt, jump over the rocks to be safe.
2) Land Mines - These small objects which flash white and red make their first appearance after point J in the beginner course. Like pits, they can not be destroyed and must be jumped over. They tend to occur in rapid succession, so it is recommended that you travel no faster than regular speed until you are an expert player. When two mines are approximately two moon buggy lengths apart, it is important to jump over the first one considerably early so that you don't land on the second, and have enough time to jump off the ground before you reach it.
3) Boulders - At certain points along your patrol, the elevation of the moon's surface rises. The first such occurrence is between points P and Q in the beginner course. While you are driving uphill, it is not uncommon to encounter boulders rolling down towards your buggy. Like rocks, these boulders can be rendered harmless with your cannon. Even the small boulders present little challenge thanks to the incline of the surface elevating them to the level of your cannon. But be prepared for a difficult jump if too many come at you at once and you don't have enough time to destroy them all.
4) Tanks - These first appear after point U in the beginner course. They are stationary, and typically fire one bullet at a time in your direction. Their bullets and the shots from your cannon cancel each other out, so you must immediately fire again in order to hit the tank. Any delay on your part will result in the tank firing once more, preventing you from destroying the tank before you reach it. Tanks can be jumped over if necessary.
5) Rocket Cars - The first of these appears after point A in the champion course. It will trail behind you until it is ready to strike. Stay fast, and don't do anything until it begins to approach you. When it is half-way between you and the edge of the screen, jump up and let it sail underneath you. Fire as soon as you land to destroy it for 500 points. 
6) Space Plants - A strange type of vegetation exists on the moon, favouring to make their homes in the craters of the lunar surface. They bob in and out of the craters in an effort to catch whatever they can grab. These space plants first appear shortly before point H in the champion course. A shot from the cannon is enough to render the space plant harmless, but the crater must still be leaped over. Attempting to leap over a crater that still contains a space plant can be a dangerous gamble if not timed perfectly.

ENEMIES IN THE AIR
Alien Craft : There are three types of craft that the enemy employs when trying to defeat you from overhead. They all appear in groups ranging from two to five.
1) Regular Craft - These weave back and forth dropping bombs on the buggy. The bombs can be destroyed with your anti-air gun, but they make difficult targets. If this craft is left on the screen for too long in later levels, it may fly down to collide with your buggy.
2) Elliptical craft - These behave nearly identical to the regular craft. They drop bombs on you with increasing accuracy. The long you remain at a particular speed, the better their shots will get, so make sure to mix your speed up in order to confuse them. Sometimes, you can jump at the last minute and avoid getting hit if the bomb is about to hit the back of your buggy.
3) Tri-orb craft - This craft, made of three circles bound together, is the deadliest of them all. Rather than dropping normal bombs at the buggy, they pitch terrain deforming grenades at the path ahead of you. You must watch the trajectory of their small flashing grenades and anticipate when you might need to jump as a result of the newly formed pit left by their grenade's impact with the ground. Like the bombs, the grenades can be shot, but they are even harder to hit."

";"Mr. Do! is a colourful and addictive maze game in which the player takes on the role of the eponymous Mr. Do, a circus clown, who must clear each level of either cherries or monsters. The game's single screen levels are made up of tunnels surrounded by a colourful, soil-like substance. This soil can be dug through to create new tunnels, allowing Mr. Do to escape his enemies and to reach the many cherries that litter the levels. A number of apples are also scattered around each level, and Mr. Do can push them along tunnels (to block and/or kill monsters) or can tunnel beneath them to drop them onto the heads of any pursuing enemies. Mr. Do himself can also be killed by a falling apple.

Mr. Do is armed with a 'Powerball' that can be fired down a tunnel, it will then bounce around the tunnels until it either returns to Mr. Do, or comes into contact with, and kills, one of the level's monsters. The Powerball regenerates immediately the first time you use it, but takes longer each time it is used to return to your hands. As each level progresses, the monsters themselves start to dig tunnels of their own in their pursuit of Mr. Do. Monsters can also push the apples.

Each screen has a doorway through which the monsters enter the level. Once all of the monsters have appeared, the doorway will turn into a 'prize', (ice cream, biscuits, etc.). If Mr. Do collects the prize, the 'Alphamonster' and his three 'Muncher' henchmen will appear. The Alphamonster may be in the EXTRA box at the top of the screen or be moving around the screen. The Alphamonster and the Munchers cannot be easily crushed under apples because they tend to eat them. They can be killed individually with the Powerball or by killing the Alphamonster itself, at which point any remaining Munchers will turn into apples.

After every three levels, there is a brief intermission in which a tune is played and a large, animated Mr. Do appears, together with some of the game's monsters. The time to complete each level and the preferred method (monsters, cherries, Alphamonsters, or Diamond) is shown. The paths in the first level resemble a 'D', after this each level's tunnels resemble a digit, ('2', '3', '4' etc.) up to '0' for level 10.

A level can be completed any one of several different ways : either by collecting all of the on-screen cherries; by killing all of the monsters, by completing the EXTRA box, or by collecting the diamond. The latter appears only very occasionally ('Special' awards an extra credit)."

The Powerball regenerates immediately the first time you use it, but takes longer each time it is used to return to your hands. As each level progresses, the monsters themselves start to dig tunnels of their own in their pursuit of Mr. Do. Monsters can also push the apples.

Each screen has a doorway through which the monsters enter the level. Once all of the monsters have appeared, the doorway will turn into a 'prize', (ice cream, biscuits, etc.). If Mr. Do collects the prize, the 'Alphamonster' and his three 'Muncher' henchmen will appear. The Alphamonster may be in the EXTRA box at the top of the screen or be moving around the screen. The Alphamonster and the Munchers cannot be easily crushed under apples because they tend to eat them. They can be killed individually with the Powerball or by killing the Alphamonster itself, at which point any remaining Munchers will turn into apples.

After every three levels, there is a brief intermission in which a tune is played and a large, animated Mr. Do appears, together with some of the game's monsters. The time to complete each level and the preferred method (monsters, cherries, Alphamonsters, or Diamond) is shown. The paths in the first level resemble a 'D', after this each level's tunnels resemble a digit, ('2', '3', '4' etc.) up to '0' for level 10.

A level can be completed any one of several different ways : either by collecting all of the on-screen cherries; by killing all of the monsters, by completing the EXTRA box, or by collecting the diamond. The latter appears only very occasionally ('Special' awards an extra credit)."

";"Mr. Do! is a colourful and addictive maze game in which the player takes on the role of the eponymous Mr. Do, a circus clown, who must clear each level of either cherries or monsters. The game's single screen levels are made up of tunnels surrounded by a colourful, soil-like substance. This soil can be dug through to create new tunnels, allowing Mr. Do to escape his enemies and to reach the many cherries that litter the levels. A number of apples are also scattered around each level, and Mr. Do can push them along tunnels (to block and/or kill monsters) or can tunnel beneath them to drop them onto the heads of any pursuing enemies. Mr. Do himself can also be killed by a falling apple.

2463;mslug;mslug;"Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001 (c) 1996 Nazca.
";"A scrolling 'run-and-gun' platform game for one or two players, Metal Slug is a humorous parody of war and specifically of World War II and the Nazis.

The game features six enemy-packed levels, referred to as 'missions'. Players start the game armed only with a pistol, but extra weapons can be picked up and used for greater firepower. Also, at certain points during a level players will find an unused 'Super Vehicle-001' - or Metal Slug - tank which can be entered and driven. The Metal Slug is slow-moving but has very powerful weapons. If the Slug takes too many hits it will break down and start to flash, the player must then quickly exit the vehicle before it explodes. The enemy troops also have vehicles at their disposal, such as tanks, boats and helicopters.

The levels are littered with bearded hostages who, when rescued, award players with either points bonuses (in the form of medals) or weapon power-ups. Available weapons are Heavy Machine Gun, Flame Shot, Rocket Launcher and Shotgun. Hand grenades are also available.

Each level ends with at least one large enemy 'Boss' vehicle that takes many hits to destroy. Once the boss has been destroyed, bonus points are awarded for each prisoner rescued. Further bonus points are awarded if the player's Metal Slug vehicle has survived the boss battle."
2464;mslug2;mslug2;"Metal Slug 2 - Super Vehicle-001/II (c) 1998 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].
";"The heroes of Metal Slug, Marco and Tarma, are called into action once again to take on the might of General Morden and his armies in this, the first of several sequels to the superb 1996 original. This time, however, Morden has acquired a number of powerful allies to aid him in his evil schemes, some of which are not even human. The 2 brave soldiers are called upon to deal with this threat once again, aided by members of the newly founded 'Sparrow Squad', Fio and Eri.

Metal Slug 2 improved on much of what made the first game great; featuring more enemies, larger bosses, more weapons, more vehicles, more hostages, more surprises and more humour than its illustrious predecessor. The occasional moments of slowdown that blighted the first game are still present, however."
2465;mslug3;mslug3;"Metal Slug 3 (c) 2000 SNK.
";"The heroes of the first 2 games return once more to do battle with the ever-present General Morden and his vast army. The third game of the series places a greater emphasis on defeating hulking boss characters than the 2 previous outings. Metal Slug 3 also introduced multiple routes through most levels, vastly increasing the replay value of the game. For example; on the first level the player reaches a point where they can either continue over land, or enter a small submarine and head down into the ocean depths, where they will be faced with a variety of huge, deadly sea-dwelling creatures.

Metal Slug 3 introduced a number of new elements that have a direct effect on the player's character - similar to the 'mummification' of the second game. The first of these is the 'fatty' affect : should the player pick up too much food (fish, for example) their character will morph in an obese version of itself. This doesn't have any detrimental effect on performance and is included purely for reasons of humour. Another effect is the now infamous 'Zombiefication'; should the player's character be attacked by a Zombie, he or she will become Zombie until they are either killed, or pick up a first-aid, which will restore the player's character back to human form. Movement while in the zombie state is slow and restricted but the player is armed with what can perhaps be best described as the 'Zombie Vomit'; a huge arc of blood that can be used to destroy oncoming enemies. A second Zombie attack while the player's character is in a Zombie state will result in the player losing a life."

";"Originally released to improve upon some of the problems the previous Metal Slug game (""Metal Slug 2 - Super Vehicle-001/II"") had, most notably its notorious slowdown, this update also implemented several changes to beef up the gameplay, such as new enemies, a different end boss layout and a number of new weapons and secrets.

";"In this, the first proper sequel to Namco's legendary pill eating maze game, players must once again run around a number of mazes, eating all of the pills that are scattered throughout. The ever-present ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Sue) return to hamper the player's progress. The infamous 'Power Pills' are also present and correct, with four appearing in each maze. 

Namco introduced a number of changes and enhancements over the original game. The first difference is in the main character. For the first time in video-game history, the game's lead character was female. Ms. Pac-Man is almost identical to the original character with two main differences; she wears a bow in her 'hair', and is also wearing lipstick. 

Another change from the original is that the bonus fruit items are no longer static but now move randomly around the mazes. 

Ms Pac-Man features four different maze layouts, which alternate every two to four rounds : 

The first maze is only encountered in Rounds 1 and 2, and has 220 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze equidistant from the center of the maze. You must clear this maze two times before moving on to the next maze. 

The second maze is only encountered in Rounds 3, 4, and 5, and has 240 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze; one set in the lower half, and the other set at the very top. You must clear this maze three times before moving on to the next maze. 

The third maze is first encountered in Round 6 and has 238 dots and 4 Power Pills. Unlike all other mazes, there is only one set of tunnels in this maze, slightly above the center of the board. You must clear this maze four times before moving on to the next maze. 

The fourth and final unique maze is first encountered in Round 10 and has 234 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze, directly next to one another in the middle of the maze. The turns at the entrance to the tunnels change the usual immediate accessibility of the tunnels and should be taken in to account. You must clear this maze four times before moving on to the next maze. 

After Round 13, the game alternates every four rounds between the third and fourth mazes. 

Finally, the ghosts' movement patterns are also completely different from those of the original game. 

As in the original game, intermission scenes will be played after certain rounds. Ms. Pac-Man's intermissions tell the story of how Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man met, fell in love, and had a baby. Ms. Pac-Man's intermissions are also preceded by a sign and a title. 3 intermissions are present : 

1) Act I - They Meet : Pac-Man, the star of the original game, enters the screen being chased by Inky while Ms. Pac-Man enters from the other side being chased by Pinky. As the two of them are about to collide, they quickly move upwards, causing Inky and Pinky to collide. Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man face each other at the top of the screen, and a heart appears above them. This intermission is played after Round 2. 

2) Act II - The Chase : Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man are seen giving each other a playful chase. One chases the other in one direction, and they take turns alternating who chases who and in what direction. After three turns, they chase each other twice more at a faster speed. This intermission is played after Round 5. 

3) Act III - Junior : Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man anxiously await the arrival of a stork, who flies overhead with a bundle. As the stork is about to pass over them, he releases the bundle, which drops to the ground in front of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, and opens up to reveal a baby Pac.

";"Basically this game is ""Pac-Man"", with a few minor differences. The major difference is that the ghosts have fewer restrictions on their movement, making them more formidable. Also adding to the challenge are the different mazes and the fact that the fruit no longer stays in one place, but moves in, out and around the maze. Fortunately there is a power pellet in each corner that (usually) turns the ghosts blue for a period of time, allowing you to eat them for points.

The main difference being the order of levels has been changed. As in the regular ""Ms. Pac-Man"" game, the maze turns invisible at a certain point. However, in Ms. Pac Attacks, this point is reached much earlier - at about the 144th screen instead of the 255th."

";"The land has been cast in darkness by Drokmar, who has been corrupted by the Black Orb; an artefact that promises immortality to anyone who comes under the influence of the orb's powerful sorcery. Two warriors set out to fight their way through fifty levels of platform beat-em-up, in order to destroy the orb - which lies at the top of the Dragon Tower - and free their lands.

Treasure chests litter the levels which, when smashed open, release treasure items, magic power-ups, keys, food and weapons. As players fight their way through the levels, they will come across a number of trapped prisoners. As long as the heroes are carrying keys, prisoners can be released who will then fight alongside the players, with each prisoner possessing their own unique attacks. Weapons and power-ups can be picked up to aid players in their quest and food can be found and eaten to increase player health.

As the players ascend the tower, they will be granted new magical weapons after each boss they defeat. The player's weapons are affected by a 'magic bar' that charges over time. When fully charged, the weapon has a powerful ranged attack, but when not charged only a close attack is produced. A magical staff will grant increased range attack ability. A magical blast may be generated by pressing the Attack and Jump buttons at once, but costs health.

There are multiple paths in the game, and two separate endings. Hidden doors can be used to skip levels when found - usually by attacking a wall or a particular spot."

2532;myqbert;myqbert;"Q*bert (c) 1982 Gottlieb.
";"The object of the Q*bert game is to change the color of the top of the cubes to the Destination Color indicated at the upper-left corner of the screen (below Player 1's score) by hopping onto them. When all the cubes in the pyramid have been changed to the Destination Color, the screen will advance to the next round, with the player-controlled Q*bert character starting back on the top cube. At the beginning of each level, there will be a short demonstration cycle with Q*bert hopping around four cubes to explain to the player the play action of each level. Each level consists of four rounds. The current level number and round number is displayed at the upper-right corner of the screen (below Player 2's score in a 2-player game).

Gameplay starts with Q*bert appearing at the top of the pyramid. The joystick will move Q*bert from cube to cube by hopping in any of four diagonal directions. Q*bert can move anywhere on the pyramid, but jumping off will kill him. Hopping onto a rotating disk will take Q*bert back to the top of the pyramid. In the first two rounds of play, Q*bert will have to avoid touching the red and purple balls. These deadly objects drop randomly onto the second-from-the-top row of the pyramid and bounce downwards. The red balls will fall off the bottom, but the purple ball will stop at the bottom and hatch into Coily, the snake which chases Q*bert. To get rid of Coily, lure him to the edge, then jump unto a disk. The disk will take Q*bert back to the top and Coily will fall off, awarding 500 points and clearing the board of all other 'nasty' characters.

Starting at the third round of play, other 'nasty' characters come into play. The green characters or objects are safe to hop onto and will award points. All other 'nasty' characters are deadly to touch. In the third round the red balls will stop falling, but two purple characters named Ugg and Wrong Way will appear at the lower portion of the pyramid and travel sideways and upwards (Ugg is the one with the snout moving from right to left on the right face of the cubes, and Wrong Way is the one with the big eyes moving from left to right on the left face of the cubes). They will not chase Q*bert, but will move randomly to get in Q*bert's way. In the third round and every round after, based on an internal timer, a green ball will appear and bounce down from the top of the pyramid. Hopping Q*bert onto the green ball will award 100 points, and freeze all the 'nasty' characters on the screen for a few seconds, but 'Q*bert' will still be able to move to complete the color changes.

During the fourth round of play, two green characters named Slick and Sam will appear, based on the internal timer (Slick is the one wearing shades; Sam does not wear shades, otherwise their function is identical). They will drop onto the second-from-the-top row of the pyramid and hop randomly downwards. If they hop onto a cube that Q*bert has already changed the color of, the cube will change to a different color to thwart Q*bert. Hopping Q*bert onto Slick or Sam will stop them and award 300 points.

Throughout the remaining rounds, all the characters and objects will appear in random combinations with increasing speed.

To add variety to the game, the Flying Discs will change positions every round, and in the higher levels the number of Flying Discs will change.

During Level 2, the play action will increase in difficulty from changing the cubes to one color, to changing the color of the cubes twice. This means that each cube would have to be hopped on twice to change the pyramid to the Destination Color, completing the Round.

Starting at Level 3 and for all remaining rounds, and levels, the play action will become more difficult. The object remains to change the cubes to the Destination Color, but if Q*bert hops on any cube, that cube will change color. So even if the cube has already been changed to the Destination Color, it will change again.

Here is a rundown of how all the colors change :

Legend :
S - Starting Color
I - Intermediate Color
D - Destination Color

LEVEL 1 : When Q*bert jumps on S or I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D (NOTE : During the fourth round, when Slick/Sam jumps on D, it changes to I).

LEVEL 2 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D.

LEVEL 3 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again.

LEVEL 4 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to I. Q*bert must start again.

LEVEL 5 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again.

LEVELS 6-9 : Same color pattern as Level 5. The difference is the increased speed of Q*bert and the 'nasty' characters.

There are also bonus points awarded at the end of each round for successfully completing the round. The bonus for the completion of the 1st round is 1,000 points. This Bonus will progressively increase each Round by 250 points to a maximum of 5,000 points at Level 5."

Players are armed with both Shuriken throwing stars and with a sword for close encounters. Numerous boxes are scattered throughout the levels (or are being carried by enemies), all of which contain bonus items such as weapon power-ups or energy-replenishing food. Other power-ups include an invulnerability shield (known as the ""Shinobi Shield"") which lasts a few seconds and a ""Smart Bomb"" power-up, which destroys all on-screen enemies.

2572;nebulryj;nebulrayj;"Nebulasray (c) 1994 Namco.
";"NebulasRay is a vertically scrolling shoot'em up for one or two players. Civil war has broken out in the Austral star system, with the militaristic 'Master Forces' ousting the ruling government and looking to seize control of the entire system. 

Taking on the role of resistance fighters, players must battle through waves of enemy ships across 6 levels, before finally reaching and destroying the 'Master Fortress'. As well as forward-firing weapons, each player ship also carries a limited number of powerful bombs that inflict much greater damage on the enemy than the standard weapons. Initially, each player ship is armed with only 3 bombs. 

Numerous weapons and power-ups can be picked up during play, each of which can itself be powered-up: 
* WIDE SHOT - Increases shot width. 5 levels available. 
* GAIN POWER - Increases destructive power. 5 levels available. 
* SPEED UP - Increases player ship speed. 5 levels available. 
* BOMB - Extra bomb. Maximum of 7 can be carried. 
* FOUR-BARREL PHOTON - Powerful Photon torpedoes. Time-based. 
* HOMING LASER - Powerful lasers that automatically target enemies. Time-based.

Nemo finds himself unable to find the Princess however, so he and 'Flip', a strange companion who also turns up in the dream, decide to explore Slumberland and find the king.

Nemo is a colourful and abstract platform shoot-em-up set in the dream world of Slumberland, a surreal world in which childrens' toys are running amok and must be destroyed. Nemo is armed with a magical staff that emits a burst of magic to destroy the many enemies, some of which require multiple hits. A number of power-ups also appear at regular intervals to aid Nemo in his quest through seven tough stages."

This game is a hack of ""PuckMan"". The name of this hack is a play on one of Namco's other arcade games that was popular in Japan, known as ""New Rally-X"".

New Puck-X contains a fairly altered maze. Bumps have been added to the center of the rows that were once wide open. Holes have been added to various portions of the maze that were once solid.

There are two extra sets of tunnels, one each above and below the original tunnel. Meanwhile, greater access has been given to the center tunnel, so you could be ambushed by ghosts before you even reach the tunnel at all.

During the attract mode, the ghosts are introduced by their American names and nicknames.

New Puck-X also changes the point values of certain elements (see Scoring below).

2596;nightstr;nightstru;"Night Striker (c) 1989 Taito.
";"Night Striker is a 3-D shoot-em-up rendered with fast moving, sprite-scaled graphics. Players must guide an armoured hover car through a number of scrolling levels - destroying waves of enemies in the process - in an attempt to rescue a scientist who has been kidnapped by a terrorist organization. A large guardian awaits players at the end of each level, with each one taking several hits to destroy.

Instead of having a set number of lives, the player's vehicle is equipped with a shield that depletes whenever the player is hit by enemy fire or has collisions with either enemies or scenery. The player's shields are recharged at the end of every level.

Night Striker takes its influences from many landmark games of the sprite scaling genre, all of which are Sega releases. The basic shoot-em-up gameplay is similar in style to both 1985's ""Space Harrier"" and 1987's ""Thunder Blade"". Some of the game's levels resemble those of 1988's ""Galaxy Force II"" as well as ""Thunder Blade"", while the game's level structure - a 'pyramid' of levels that allows players to chose their own route through the game with the use of end-of-level forked roads - is borrowed from the 1986 classic, ""Out Run""."

Interceptor
A real life missile defense style-contest as missiles are being launched from a ship, and you must use your mystical powers to stop the oncoming missiles. The outside buttons (1 & 3) make you step to the left or right, and the middle button is fire. Failure to hit the missile results in you being blown up. If you select Sharon from France, most of her clothes would disappear except for the bottom part of her suit.

Niagara Jumps
The final competition in the tournament. It is also considered to be the most difficult competition in the game. Very similar to the Triple Jump competition in the Olympics. The object is this contest is to make it across the falls. Alternately press buttons 1 and 3 to build up speed, then press button 2 three times. If you don't time yourself properly, you will sink and drown and you will go down the steep falls.

Nonstop Rock Chop
You must smash as many rocks as you can before time runs out. Rapidly press buttons 1 and 3 alternately until the gauge is full, then press button 2 to smash the rock.

Numan Sniper
In this contest, monsters will jump out of the sea from three different locations. Your object, destroy them. Press buttons 1, 2 or 3 varying by their location to shoot.

Scud Toss
Just as in the Javelin competition in the Olympics. Played on a ""Track and Field""-like field with an only exception -- a missile. Rapidly and continuously press the two run buttons and then push and hold the middle button to set the angle of which you would throw the missile. Again, like Interceptor, if you select Sharon -- then again if she is faulted, she will be missing most of her clothes.

Tower Topper
Here you are expected to climb up to the building rooftop with the fastest time possible. Press button 2 repeatedly to scale the side of a building. If you press it too early -- you won't move, but if you press it too late -- you will fall off.

Turbo Dash
Much like the 100m Dash in the Olympics -- only the core elements have slightly changed. You are racing against a drag racer and another player. Press the two outside buttons (1 & 3) in alternate fashion until your RSI (or 'special speed') sets in.

VS. Express
Very similar to a familiar scene in the Superman comic books. You must stop the oncoming train using your magical powers and send it in the opposite direction backwards. Press button 2 to stop the train, then hammer the outside buttons to build up power before bunging it back down the track. If you don't time this right -- the train will run you over."

A real life missile defense style-contest as missiles are being launched from a ship, and you must use your mystical powers to stop the oncoming missiles. The outside buttons (1 & 3) make you step to the left or right, and the middle button is fire. Failure to hit the missile results in you being blown up. If you select Sharon from France, most of her clothes would disappear except for the bottom part of her suit.

Niagara Jumps
The final competition in the tournament. It is also considered to be the most difficult competition in the game. Very similar to the Triple Jump competition in the Olympics. The object is this contest is to make it across the falls. Alternately press buttons 1 and 3 to build up speed, then press button 2 three times. If you don't time yourself properly, you will sink and drown and you will go down the steep falls.

Nonstop Rock Chop
You must smash as many rocks as you can before time runs out. Rapidly press buttons 1 and 3 alternately until the gauge is full, then press button 2 to smash the rock.

Numan Sniper
In this contest, monsters will jump out of the sea from three different locations. Your object, destroy them. Press buttons 1, 2 or 3 varying by their location to shoot.

Scud Toss
Just as in the Javelin competition in the Olympics. Played on a ""Track and Field""-like field with an only exception -- a missile. Rapidly and continuously press the two run buttons and then push and hold the middle button to set the angle of which you would throw the missile. Again, like Interceptor, if you select Sharon -- then again if she is faulted, she will be missing most of her clothes.

Tower Topper
Here you are expected to climb up to the building rooftop with the fastest time possible. Press button 2 repeatedly to scale the side of a building. If you press it too early -- you won't move, but if you press it too late -- you will fall off.

Turbo Dash
Much like the 100m Dash in the Olympics -- only the core elements have slightly changed. You are racing against a drag racer and another player. Press the two outside buttons (1 & 3) in alternate fashion until your RSI (or 'special speed') sets in.

VS. Express
Very similar to a familiar scene in the Superman comic books. You must stop the oncoming train using your magical powers and send it in the opposite direction backwards. Press button 2 to stop the train, then hammer the outside buttons to build up power before bunging it back down the track. If you don't time this right -- the train will run you over."

";"In his never ending quest for adventure and excitement, man invented off-road racing. These races were then brought before the masses by converting huge sports stadiums into dirt and mud obstacle courses in which off-road 'Ironmen' battled for top honors. 

Now the Leland Corporation brings this fast moving, hard driving sport to the video game arena. 

Ironman Ivan Stewart's Super Off-Road is stadium off-road racing at it's best. One to three players are asked to test their dirt track skills against the best dirt truck driver in the world. 

Contestants compete on eight different tracks with a total of 16 configurations and these courses are packed with enough jumps, bumps, hills, and holes to challenge even the most skillful driver. 

Winning drivers earn 'cash' prizes, and use this 'cash' to 'buff out' their machines. At the end of each race, players take their trucks to the 'Speed Shop' to buy better shocks, tires, engines, and higher top speed. They can also buy nitro packs to help them blast over the jumps and through the mud. 

The 'Convert-a-Credit' feature allows drivers to add to their winnings by using credits as 'cash'. Each additional quarter, when converted, becomes $200,000 in game 'cash' and this additional 'cash' may be used for purchases in the 'Speed Shop'."

2662;offtwalc;offtwallc;"Off The Wall (c) 1991 Atari Games Corp.
";"Off the Wall is an arcade game produced by Atari and released in North America in 1991. A modern remake of Breakout, this game introduces many new gameplay features to the bat-and-ball genre, and it incorporates some elements from Pong as well. It supports up to three players simultaneously (though most cabinets only support two), and the game's graphics include many backgrounds modeled after modern abstract art.

The objective of Off the Wall is to score as many points as possible by destroying square blocks in a never-ending series of levels. The player controls a paddle using an analog knob or a joystick (depending on the machine configuration). The paddle moves along one edge of the playfield, and a ball flies around the playfield and bounces off the walls and the paddle. When a ball hits a block, the block disappears (unless it is indestructible). A square exit is placed on the screen, and directing the ball into this exit causes all remaining blocks on the screen to self-destruct, awarding bonus points and advancing the player(s) to the next level.

The ball occasionally splits in two (in multiplayer games, three balls may be on the screen at once), and the player can put spin on the ball, causing it to move in a curved trajectory. The player loses a life when the last ball on the screen moves past the player's paddle, though in some circumstances, the game gives the player a second chance. The game is over when the player has lost all of his or her lives.

As levels progress, the game introduces new features that make the game more complex and challenging. These features include blocks that move randomly or in circles, various powerups, indestructible blocks and bombs, blocks that parachute or fly in to replace destroyed blocks, objects that change the ball's speed and trajectory, and guns that can shrink the players' paddles. Depending on the number of players in the game, some levels may be skipped due to the exit being along one player's edge of the playfield. In multiplayer games, a bonus round occurs periodically where players compete directly against one another in an exact clone of Pong. The winning player earns an extra life."

There are two weapons that the player picks up, and if the player picks up a different powerup, it will always reset to its lowest level:
(I) - Ion Laser: Shoots straight, pick up more to increase damage at a cost of decreasing length. Ideal for close combat.
(W) - Wide Shot: Shoots bullets in wider range when collecting more of them. Ideal for taking enemies from afar but deals less damage.

There are also two items that are pressed by the bomb button, and players may pick up to two of them:
Silver - Activate to slow down everything on screen. Useful to dodge bullets and getting closer for higher score.
Gold - Destroy all enemies on screen, score depends on closeness to player prior to using the item."

";"When playing this game, you are the pilot of an Omegan Space Fighter in training to defend Omega's Star Colonies. You are stationed in space to destroy as many waves of attacking enemy droid ships as possible.

You begin your training with a small number of droid ships in the first wave of attackers and gradually build your skill until there is a maximum number of 12 attacking droid ships per wave. These attaching ships not only move independently and fire at you, they also drop two different kinds of space mines to block your path and your shots at them.

As your skill level increases, the speed with which the droid ships attack is gradually increased and their shots at you become more accurate.

Bonus ships are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values. Each enemy ship and mine has a point value.

The object of the game is to survive as long as possible while destroying as many attacking droid ships and space mines as you can. As you do this, each following wave of attackers will be harder to destroy."

Unlike the limited ammo found in the first game in the series, players now have unlimited ammo. As long as the trigger is squeezed, weapons will fire on full automatic. Once the ammo meter is depleted, the rate of fire decreases sharply. When the trigger is released, the meter instantly refills. Players can also carry a limited supply of grenades, although only three bombs can be carried at any one time, as opposed to the nine of the first game. As players progress through the stages, various power-ups can be found, such as stronger weapons and extra grenades. 

A bonus round appears after every second stage. This consists of a shooting gallery and players must hit as many targets as possible to earn bonus points.

The game's five stages are:

";"Out Run is a ground-breaking racing game in which the player drives a red Ferrari Testarossa through a number of colourful European locations, trying to reach each end-of-level checkpoint before the tight time limit expires.

Each of the game's stages is packed with civilian traffic that must be carefully avoided, as players try to negotiate the game's twisting, hilly roads. 

At the end of every stage players are presented with a fork in the road, allowing them to chose which route they wish to take next. This was not the first time this feature had appeared (Tatsumi's 1983 racer, TX-1, was the first to introduce forked roads).

As well as being able to choose routes, players could also - via the game's ""in-car radio"" - choose one of three different catchy tunes to listen to while driving. The songs are 'Magical Sound Shower', 'Passing Breeze' and 'Splash Wave'."

Although you have unlimited ammunition, the enemy will make you pay for the invasion into their homeland. You will be able to accomplish this with various power-ups and also a second player (if they buy in). Your mission won't be easy but it is necessary so you can secure both the skies and ground for our troops.

The game is broken up into four missions. Within these four missions, there are 2 parts. One part involves going over land and the other part has you either going over water or being up in the air.

Fortunately there is a power pellet in each corner that (usually) turns the ghosts blue for a period of time, allowing you to eat them for points.

";"Pac-Land is a horizontally-scrolling platform game set in the cartoon world of the game's title. A fairy has lost her way and needs Pac-Man to help her get back to her home of Fairyland. Pac-Man, with the fairy safely hidden beneath his hat, must run and jump through the colourful world until he reaches and enters the magical door to Fairyland. Upon being rescued, the fairy gives Pac-Man a pair of magical shoes for his trip back home. These enable him to jump wherever he wants, without the need for a platform to jump from. This effectively means Pac-Man can 'sky-jump' back home if he so wishes.

Directional buttons make Pac-Man walk left and right and it's possible to make him run by tapping the desired directional button twice. Pac-Man is pursued by his ever-present enemies in the form of five ghosts - Pinky, Inky, Blinky, Clyde and Sue. Pac-Man must avoid the ghosts and other deadly objects that populate the levels. As with previous games in the series, a small number of 'Powerpills' appear. Eating a Powerpill makes Pac-Man temporarily invincible and turns the ghosts purple and vulnerable to being eaten. On some stages, Pac-Man must use a springboard to jump over large ponds by leaping from the springboard and rapidly moving left and right while in the air.

The game's stages are called 'trips', with players able to start on any one of the first five. Each trip made up of four rounds (three rounds to reach Fairyland and one round to return home) with a short interval between each one. The objective in all trips is to get the fairy safely back to Fairyland then return home to Pac-Man's family. The majority of the trip involves moving from left to right, avoiding various obstacles such as the enemy ghosts, water spurts and quicksand traps. The journey home, however, scrolls right to left.

Each stage must be completed within a set time limit and if the player runs out of time before finishing a round, Sue (the purple ghost) will speed up considerably and kill Pac-Man. At the end of each round, players are awarded bonus points based on how much of the time limit remains. On each stage, cherries and other items can be collected for extra points. There are a total of 8 different trips in the game, totalling 32 levels. After the 8th trip, the 9th trip is a repeat of the 5th trip, with level 33 effectively being level 17, with an increased difficulty level."

";"Pac-Mania is a 1- or 2-player game in which the player maneuvers Pac-Man through a world of 3-D mazes. He's back in action... but with a new twist, BOUNCE power! Ready for a new generation of Pac-Man players, he can't wait for the chance to show off his new aerial maneuvers to the crowd! The ""boss"" ghost Blinky has recruited the talents of two new ghosts, Common and Grey Common. Sue from ""Ms. Pac-Man"" also returns to the scene. Pac-Man must use his speed and cunning to outwit these annoying pests. 

Pac-Man now faces new challenges as he enters the worlds of Block Town, Pac-Man's Park, Sandbox Land, and Jungly Steps. Fortunately for Pac-Man, he has the help of two 'special items' - a green and red power pill. The green pill adds temporary speed, and the red awards double points for eating ghosts. It's a whole new ball game for Pac-Maniacs! 

The player's main objective is to eat all dots and power pills in the mazes while avoiding persistent ghosts. Using the new BOUNCE button, players can bounce their way over the ghosts to avoid being caught. But two new ghosts have been added to insure that Pac-Man doesn't have it too easy. In fact, Common and Grey Common can also bounce in the air like Pac-Man. Fortunately, these rivals of Pac-Man are only found in the later levels, and can only jump in the Sandbox Land and Jungly Steps mazes.

During play, the appearance of fruit and green/red power pills will trigger the bell. This alerts players immersed in the game who might otherwise miss these valuable items. A green power pill awards extra speed; it is good until a yellow or red power pill is eaten and expires or a game life is lost. Red power pills award double points for eating ghosts, and continue to do so until a game life is lost. 

An optional continue feature is offered to allow players to continue their progress without having to start back at the beginning. It's a great way for Pac-Maniacs to learn and practice strategies without having to restart games from the beginning. Bonus thresholds are offered at various score values, and are adjustable."

Matching pairs also adds time to the timer. If you lose all of your hearts or the timer runs out then it is game over.

At the start of each stage (and upon every continue) a few cards are set face-up for your advantage. Also, each stage features two joker cards (represented by the current girl's head-shot). When a joker card is selected, the next card selected removes all remaining cards with the same value.

Once the stage is completed, these bandages disappear and the image is shown in full-color.  Once all of a girl's stages are completed, the player is shown all of the backgrounds for that girl.

2762;paperboy;paperboy;"Paperboy (c) 1984 Atari Games.
";"Paperboy is a one or two-player game in which the objective is to deliver Newspapers to the Paperboy's customers from Monday through to Sunday. 

Each game begins with ten customers and ten non-customers. Paperboy's customers live in the brightly coloured houses, while non-customers live in dark coloured houses. To deliver to a customer, the player must throw a paper either into the customer's mailbox, or onto their front porch. Failure to deliver a paper to a customer results in the loss of that customer for the next day. Any damage done to a customer's property also results in the loss of that customer. Losing all ten of Paperboy's customers will get him fired and the game is over. However, on any day in which all customers have their papers successfully delivered, one of the non-customers will re-subscribe.

Non-customers' houses and yards are loaded with targets at which to throw your extra papers (windows, lamps, statues, etc.). Hitting these targets earns points for the ""Breakage Bonus"", which is displayed at the top center of the screen. The total Breakage Bonus is awarded to the player at the end of each day (or at the end of the game-whichever comes first). 

If Paperboy loses a customer, that customer's house will be dark coloured the next day. As a non-subscriber, this house now presents more targets at which to throw newspapers for building up the Breakage Bonus. At the start of each day, a map of Paperboy's route is displayed to indicate subscriber and non-subscriber houses. This helps to remind players of what customers they may have lost on the previous day and the location of remaining customers. 

Paperboy can carry a maximum of ten papers at a time, but can restock his supply by riding over paper bundles placed here and there on his route. A paper supply indicator is displayed underneath the player's score. 

While making his deliveries, Paperboy must avoid collisions with all stationary objects and other characters moving about the neighborhood.

2763;paperbr1;paperboyr1;"Paperboy (c) 1984 Atari Games.
";"Paperboy is a one or two-player game in which the objective is to deliver Newspapers to the Paperboy's customers from Monday through to Sunday. 

Each game begins with ten customers and ten non-customers. Paperboy's customers live in the brightly coloured houses, while non-customers live in dark coloured houses. To deliver to a customer, the player must throw a paper either into the customer's mailbox, or onto their front porch. Failure to deliver a paper to a customer results in the loss of that customer for the next day. Any damage done to a customer's property also results in the loss of that customer. Losing all ten of Paperboy's customers will get him fired and the game is over. However, on any day in which all customers have their papers successfully delivered, one of the non-customers will re-subscribe.

Non-customers' houses and yards are loaded with targets at which to throw your extra papers (windows, lamps, statues, etc.). Hitting these targets earns points for the ""Breakage Bonus"", which is displayed at the top center of the screen. The total Breakage Bonus is awarded to the player at the end of each day (or at the end of the game-whichever comes first). 

If Paperboy loses a customer, that customer's house will be dark coloured the next day. As a non-subscriber, this house now presents more targets at which to throw newspapers for building up the Breakage Bonus. At the start of each day, a map of Paperboy's route is displayed to indicate subscriber and non-subscriber houses. This helps to remind players of what customers they may have lost on the previous day and the location of remaining customers. 

Paperboy can carry a maximum of ten papers at a time, but can restock his supply by riding over paper bundles placed here and there on his route. A paper supply indicator is displayed underneath the player's score. 

While making his deliveries, Paperboy must avoid collisions with all stationary objects and other characters moving about the neighborhood. To avoid collisions, Paperboy can ride his bike anywhere - on the sidewalk, in the street, or into front yards. A collision with anything results in the loss of a life. 

In addition to the obstacles, non-subscribers are hostile towards Paperboy and will attack him and try to knock him down. If Paperboy damages a subscriber's property, that character may also attack. So the more customers that are lost, the more hostile the neighborhood becomes toward Paperboy.

";"The first in the hugely successful puzzle series from Taito, Puzzle Bobble is a game for 1 or 2 players in which the aim is to clear each play area of the colored bubbles that litter it. This is achieved by firing bubbles up the screen - with the angle of trajectory dictated by the player - at the clusters of static colored bubbles that litter each play area. The aim is to forms chains of like-colored bubbles, thus making them disappear. At regular intervals, the bubbles will drop one row down the screen, making life more difficult for the players. The game is over when the bubbles reach the very bottom of the play area.

In the 1-player game there are thirty rounds to complete, whereas in the 2-player Vs. mode, the winner is the player who clears their play area first. The addictive yet straightforward game-play mechanic ensured that the ""Puzzle Bobble"" games would be the most successful of their genre since Russian programmer, Alexey Pajitnov's legendary ""Tetris"" was unleashed upon the gaming world in the late 1980s."

You just pay 300 yen, stand in front of a video monitor which shows your face, choose the desired frame, pose for the photo, then wait for a sheet of 16 photo stickers which the machine spits out in about a minute. The image quality is not so high (this is probably part of the charm), but the sticker is so small that it really doesn't matter. People affix the stickers on personal articles like notebooks, cell phones, etc. But mainly, school girls collect them to show friends.

2860;penbros;penbros;"Penguin Brothers (c) 2000 Subsino.
";"A multi-screen platform game in which one or two players (either co-operatively or competitively) control a cute penguin fighting against the game's equally cute enemies. The idea is to destroy all of the on-screen enemies; once this a done, a circular key will appear; the player must pick the key up, whereupon they will be teleported to another screen which represents the second part of the stage. This screen has a silver doorway; the player must carry the key to the door - avoiding or destroying the on-screen enemies - to complete the level.

Playing as a loose cross between Taito's ""Bubble Bobble"" and Irem's ""Bomber Man"", each player's penguin is armed with bombs which are used to destroy the game's enemies, as well as obstructions - such as walls etc. - and barrels; the latter often revealing hidden bonuses that can be collected. Players must be careful to avoid blowing themselves and each other up when the bombs detonate.

Each level contains one or more 'rotating' platforms, allowing travel between upper and lower platforms. Players and enemies can stick to the underside of a rotating platform, then rotate it through 180 degrees to reach the platform above them. The opposite applies to reach a lower platform."
2861;pengo;pengo;"Pengo (c) 1982 Sega.
";"Pengo the Penguin is the eponymous star of Pengo the video game. The basic layout of Pengo is akin to that of Namco's legendary ""Pac-Man""; featuring, as it does, a top down, single screen, maze-like arrangement. Pengo's enemies, the Sno-Bees, are also similar to Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde - the ghosts that pursued Pac-Man; not least because Sno-Bees also come in four different varieties, each represented by a different color.

One aspect that distinguishes Pengo from the Namco classic is that the Maze itself is a wholly interactive environment. Each section of wall is represented as a block of ice, which can be pushed onto the Sno-Bees to destroy them. The Sno-Bees themselves will destroy the ice blocks as they move around each level, so speed is of the essence. Some of the blocks are 'Diamond blocks' which cannot be destroyed, and can be re-used by Pengo.

2867;pepper2;pepper2;"Pepper II (c) 1982 Exidy.
";"Despite its name, there was no predecessor named Pepper or Pepper I. The gameplay is similar to the game Amidar by Konami and Stern.

There are four mazes per level in Pepper II. Each maze has exits leading to 3 other mazes. All four mazes must be filled to advance to the next level. To fill in a maze, the player maneuvers ""Pepper"" around different segments of the maze. As Pepper travels, he leaves a ""zipper"". Once he encloses or ""zips"" a segment, it fills in and points are awarded. If Pepper backtracks on an uncompleted segment, it unzips.

The character ""Pepper"" is an angel. There are two types of enemies that must be avoided: ""Roaming Eyes"" and the "" Whippersnapper"" who unzips all uncompleted, zipped segments by moving over them. Pepper's one defense is to enclose an area containing a pitchfork ""energizer"", which turns him into a devil for approximately four seconds. At that time he can go after all Roaming Eyes for points. At the same time, the Whippersnapper freezes. There are four pitchforks in the corners of every maze. A deluxe energizer is located in the center of each maze. This energizer alternates between being a pitchfork and a halo symbol. If Pepper encloses the middle area when the energizer is a halo, the Whippersnapper will disappear from the maze.

Points are made for enclosing a segment, consuming a pair of roaming eyes when energized by the pitchfork (similar to Pac-Man), obtaining prizes, completing a maze, and completing 4 mazes. A bonus turn is awarded at 40,000, 50,000, 70,000 or 90,000 points, depending on the dip switch settings.

Each maze also contains a prize in one of the segments. The player must enclose the area it appears in to gain the prize and points, and then the prize is shown beneath the maze."

2875;pfghtj;pfghtj;"Pocket Fighter (c) 1997 Capcom.
";"A superb, abstract and humorous fighting game featuring miniaturized renditions from several Capcom fighting games; including the legendary ""Street Fighter"" series, as well as ""Darkstalkers"" and the little-known ""Red Earth"".

During a bout, players will be able to release coloured gems from successful attacks against their opponent, as well as from wooden chests that regularly appear. Collecting these gems will 'power-up' the player's character, giving them more powerful attacks. There are two bars and three sub-bars in the interface. The two main bars are the life bar and the super bar; the first indicates the player's health and the second their ability to throw super combos. The Super Bar itself can be filled up to nine levels, allowing players to execute more super combos. Each super combo has a level assigned to it, and it uses Super Bars depending on it.

The 3 sub-bars show the level of 3 of each player's special moves. Each character has at least three special moves, as shown in the sub-bars, and each of these corresponds to a color. Some characters have one or two additional Special Moves that aren't affected by sub-bars. Each time a player shoots their opponent, gems pop out of him or her, and the attacker can take them to power up their own special moves according to the colors.

There are 4 buttons : PUNCH, KICK, SPECIAL, and TAUNT. The Special button is a chargeable move that cannot be blocked and upon impact drops gems in the opponent's possession. More gems will be dropped depending on how much the player charges the attack. Holding Down, Forward or no direction at all when using the Special button will cause a specific gem color to drop from the enemy. Holding Back along with the Special button allows for a defense that is specific against the unblockable Special attacks. Other kinds of attacks do no damage when blocked, and unlike most 2-D fighting games, this includes special and super moves.

Pocket Fighter also features Flash Combos in which a player can execute a combo by pressing the KICK or PUNCH button after they have hit their opponent using the PUNCH button for a total of 4 hits. Flash Combos will usually cause a player's fighter (except Ryu) to change into various costumes during the sequence, and perform a powerful attack in the end. This final hit is usually the hardest in the sequence to connect with. These costumes range from uniforms (such as traffic cops or schoolgirls), to swimsuits, and even cameos of other Capcom characters. For example, Chun-Li may turn into Jill Valentine from the Resident Evil series, while Felicia may turn into Mega Man or other Darkstalkers characters not playable in the game.

The commands are also very easy compared to the Street Fighter series, thanks to SPECIAL button. By doing a motion (for example : qcf or hcf) and pressing the Special Button the fighter will launch his or her super combo.

In addition to the usual punches, kicks and fireballs, each character has a couple of very abstract yet powerful 'special' attacks; which can range from the player producing a huge mallet (Ken), to standing on a podium and motioning a bicycle race through the opposing fighter (Chun Li)."

2884;phoenix;phoenix;"Phoenix (c) 1980 Amstar.
";"Phoenix is a classic vertical shoot-em-up in the mould of Taito's ""Space Invaders"" and Namco's ""Galaxian"", but takes the concept further with the introduction of progressive stages of play (instead of simply repeating a single playfield over and over with an increasing difficulty level). 

The player pilots a lone ship that can only move left and right along the botton of the playfield and fire upwards. The ship can also utilize a temporary 'Force Field' to protect it from missiles and birds. Any birds that that collide with the Force Field are destroyed. The Force Field only lasts for two seconds, but then cannot be used again for another five seconds. 

There are five attack waves to each round of play. 

The first wave begins with a formation of sixteen birds attacking the player's ship. They drop missiles and dive at the ship in an effort to destroy it. 

The second wave is a variation of the first, only with a different enemy attack pattern. 

The third wave begins with pattern of eight eggs that hatch into blue Phoenix birds that then attack the player's ship. These birds can be destroyed by rocket fire from the ship. If the rocket hits the bird on center, the bird is destroyed. If the rocket hits the bird to the left or right of center, only that wing of the bird is destroyed. The wing will regenerate itself if the bird is not quickly destroyed. 

The fourth wave is similar to the third, only with two banks of eggs instead of one. 

The fifth and final wave is the attack of the Space fortress mothership; a huge mothership piloted by a purple-coloured Alien Queen who sends down waves of small birds to attack the player's ship, as well as launching missiles from the mothership itself. The Alien Queen is protected by a barrier that must be shot several times before both the Queen and the mothership are destroyed.

Once the mothership has been destroyed, the game starts over with an increased level of difficulty.

The additional gameplay elements seem to be at the expense of hardware performance. Despite having more basic graphics than ""Galaxian"", Phoenix's ships move in a very mechanical fashion compared to the smooth, nicely animated movements of Namco's classic."

";"Pleiads is a 2-D, space shooter style game. With its many interesting visual and audio effects, this game is sure to challenge the most avid player.

Each round of play includes 4 different stages. With the onset of the melodious background tune, the first stage of play begins.

Against a backdrop of planets and twinkling stars, the Earth City must be protected from sixteen attacking Martians. These Martian attackers have the ability to transform from flying Martians, to walking Martians, or to UFOs. The walking Martians build barriers across the Earth City. These barriers must be destroyed.

The Earth Spaceship can be maneuvered right and left. With the use of the 'warp' button, it can be randomly relocated when necessary. These, plus a backup of stationary defense weapons, aid in protecting the Earth City and Spaceship, as well as in destroying the Martian Attackers. When all but the two final Martians have been destroyed, a tone of dusk shades the Earth City. As these two attackers meet their end, the Earth Spaceship ascends into space to meet the challenge of Stage II.

In this second stage of play, the Earth Spaceship encounters eight Space Monsters. To destroy these Monsters, they must be hit in the direct center. When a Space Monster with burning wings is destroyed, up to 400 points can be added to your score. When all the Space Monsters have been destroyed, the Earth Spaceship prepares for Stage III.

In this third stage of play, the Earth Spaceship is confronted with the Martian Space Battleship and its unseen forces. This Martian Battleship contains five closed chambers, each protected by a rocket flame. Each chamber opens periodically at random, to release a defending reserve of Martian attackers. When a flame below an open chamber is extinguished, point value of the Martian Space Battleship increases. This enemy ship can be destroyed by either eliminating all sixteen Martian attackers, or by extinguishing all five rocket flames. When the Martian Space Battleship finally explodes, the Earth Spaceship moves on to Stage IV.

This last stage of play begins with an emergency signal, SOS, SOS, SOS, AT ONCE RETURN TO EARTH. The Earth Spaceship is now ready to be guided on its journey, through a landing corridor, back to its home base. The Earth Spaceship must be carefully maneuvered around other spaceships in order to avoid destruction. Clearing flags will add bonus points to your score. When the Earth Spaceship has been safely maneuvered to its arrival target, 500 to 4,000 points will be added to your score, while bursts of fireworks greet your arrival and signal the beginning of a new round of play."

These Martian attackers have the ability to transform from flying Martians, to walking Martians, or to UFOs. The walking Martians build barriers across the Earth City. These barriers must be destroyed.

The Earth Spaceship can be maneuvered right and left. With the use of the 'warp' button, it can be randomly relocated when necessary. These, plus a backup of stationary defense weapons, aid in protecting the Earth City and Spaceship, as well as in destroying the Martian Attackers. When all but the two final Martians have been destroyed, a tone of dusk shades the Earth City. As these two attackers meet their end, the Earth Spaceship ascends into space to meet the challenge of Stage II.

In this second stage of play, the Earth Spaceship encounters eight Space Monsters. To destroy these Monsters, they must be hit in the direct center. When a Space Monster with burning wings is destroyed, up to 400 points can be added to your score. When all the Space Monsters have been destroyed, the Earth Spaceship prepares for Stage III.

In this third stage of play, the Earth Spaceship is confronted with the Martian Space Battleship and its unseen forces. This Martian Battleship contains five closed chambers, each protected by a rocket flame. Each chamber opens periodically at random, to release a defending reserve of Martian attackers. When a flame below an open chamber is extinguished, point value of the Martian Space Battleship increases. This enemy ship can be destroyed by either eliminating all sixteen Martian attackers, or by extinguishing all five rocket flames. When the Martian Space Battleship finally explodes, the Earth Spaceship moves on to Stage IV.

This last stage of play begins with an emergency signal, SOS, SOS, SOS, AT ONCE RETURN TO EARTH. The Earth Spaceship is now ready to be guided on its journey, through a landing corridor, back to its home base. The Earth Spaceship must be carefully maneuvered around other spaceships in order to avoid destruction. Clearing flags will add bonus points to your score. When the Earth Spaceship has been safely maneuvered to its arrival target, 500 to 4,000 points will be added to your score, while bursts of fireworks greet your arrival and signal the beginning of a new round of play."

2940;polepos;poleposj;"Pole Position (c) 1982 Namco.
";"Pole Position is a 1-player game using a color raster-scan video display. Game action takes place at the Fuji Speedway in Japan. The country around the speedway consists of green meadows, hills, and snow-capped Mt. Fuji. 

The player drives a Formula-1 race car on the track. The first objective of the game is to finish the qualifying lap as quickly as possible. If the player beats the clock, he or she qualifies for the race. If not, he or she drives out the remainder of the time along the qualifying course. 

As a qualifier, the player is ranked according to his or her qualifying lap time, from the 1st (pole) position to the 8th. The second objective of the game is to race against the clock and other cars to finish the specified number of laps ('Nr. of Laps' dip switch setting; 3 laps is the default) of the race as fast as possible and to achieve the highest score possible. The player earns points for passing cars, driving on the track, and finishing the race with time remaining. He or she is rewarded with an extended-play lap for completing the first lap within a certain amount of time (depending on the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting). 

The game starts with the player's car behind the starting line and a certain amount of time, in seconds ('Game Time' dip switch setting; the default is 90 seconds), will be on the clock. The player's car must finish the qualifying lap within a certain amount of time (which varies depending on the 'Practice Rank' dip switch setting) to be in the race. If the player does not qualify, his or her car continues on the track until the 'Game Time' elapses.

If the player has qualified, just before the race begins, the player's car (flashing on the screen) is placed at the starting line with seven other cars. The position of the car depends on the position earned during the qualifying lap. (The player's car is always place at the 8th position in the attract mode.)

The starting lights flash from red to green, and the race begins. Racing hazards are other racing cars, sharp turns, road signs, and water puddles. (All of these hazards except for water puddles are also present on the qualifying lap.) As the race progresses, more cars appear on the track. If the player's car hits another car or a road sign, it is destroyed in an explosion. The player's car reappears in a few seconds and the race continues. Driving through water puddles or off the track slows down the player's car. 

Racing into the first turn, the player must let up on the accelerator slightly to make the corner. Road signs flash along the side of the track. Depending on how well the player manipulates the controls, he or she can either roar through the hairpin turns like a champion or spin out in a flaming crash. He or she jockeys for position with the other racers, while keeping his or her eye on the clock at the top of the screen. When time runs out, the race is over. If the player has beaten the racing lap time and has seconds remaining, the remaining seconds are added to the extended lap time, which varies depending on the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting. 

The top score achieved by a player appears at the top of the screen. The time allotted for the lap is displayed under the top score. Increasing lap time (in seconds and hundredths of a second) and the speed of the car appears last."

";"Pole Position II is a 1-player game using a color raster-scan video display. Game action takes place at four different raceways - the Fuji Speedway in Japan, the Test Track (an oval track like Indy), the Seaside Speedway (with the Long Beach Pike in the background), and the Suzuka Speedway in Japan. The unique and picturesque scenery around each raceway adds exciting realism to each race! 

The player drives a Formula-1 race car on each track. The first objective of the game is to finish the qualifying lap as quickly as possible. If the player beats the time, he or she qualifies for the race. If not, he or she drives the remainder of his time along the qualifying course. 

As a qualifier, the player is ranked according to his or her qualifying lap time, from the 1st (pole) position to 8th. The second objective of the game is to race against the clock and other cars to finish the specified number of laps ('Nr. of Laps' dip switch setting; 3 laps is the default) of the race as fast as possible, and to achieve the highest score possible. The player earns points for passing cars, driving on the track, and finishing the race with time remaining. The player is rewarded with an extended-play lap for completing the first lap within a certain amount of time (depending on the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting). 

To start play, the player must first insert the correct number of coin(s) for a game (according to the coin dip switch settings, 1 coin/1 credit is the default for both 'Coin A' and 'Coin B' dips). The player then turns the steering wheel until the track he or she wants to drive on is highlighted in white. The game starts when the player steps on the accelerator. The player's car will appear behind the starting line and a certain amount of time, in seconds ('Game Time' dip switch setting; the default is 90 seconds), will be on the clock. The player's car must finish the qualifying lap within a certain amount of time (which varies depending on the 'Practice Rank' dip switch setting) to be in the race. If the player does not qualify, his or her car continues on the track until the 'Game Time' elapses.

(All of these hazards except for water puddles are also present on the qualifying lap.) As the race progresses, more cars appear on the track. If the player's car hits another car or a road sign, it is destroyed in an explosion (Pole Position II adds flying debris to the visual effect). The player's car reappears in a few seconds and the race continues. Driving through water puddles or off the track slows down the player's car even more than in the original ""Pole Position"". 

Experience will teach the player which turns on which tracks require slight steering (because they're banked) and which turns require fast and forceful steering. The player jockeys for position with the other racers, while keeping his or her eye on the clock at the top of the screen. When time runs out, the race is over. If the player has beaten the racing lap time and has seconds remaining, the remaining seconds are added to the extended lap time, which varies depending on the track and the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting. 

The top score achieved by a player appears at the top of the screen. The time allotted for the lap is displayed under the top score. Increasing lap time (in seconds and hundredths of a second) and the speed of the car appear last. Each track has its own separate high score list."

";"One or two players control safari-suited characters armed with harpoon guns, who must destroy the numerous different-sized balloons that litter each stage. When hit by a harpoon, the balloons break down into smaller fragments, in a similar fashion to Atari's 1979 classic, ""Asteroids"".

Players can only fire the harpoon guns virtually upwards, but can move left and right, as well as climbing the ladders that appear on many of the levels. Each of the game's fifty levels is played against a backdrop of one of seventeen famous world landmarks. All balloons must be destroyed before players can advance to the next screen.

The game's levels each contain a different layout of blocks. While most of these are permanent fixtures, some disappear when shot, while others reveal hidden bonuses. Food item bonuses occasionally appear that can be collected for bonus points.

Player start each stage armed with only a single-shot harpoon, but some balloons, when popped, release special weapons that drop down to the bottom of the screen. Players then have a few seconds to collect the power-up before it disappears. Available power-ups are:
* A twin harpoon that allows two shots at once.
* A grappling hook that will stay attached to the ceiling or block for a short period of time.
* A rapid-fire gun. 

Other non-weapon bonuses include:
* A force field.
* An hour-glass that slows the balloons' movement.
* A clock that freezes the balloons for a short time.
* An extra life.
* Dynamite, that will pop all remaining balloons down to their smallest size."

";"The player takes on the role of a bow-and-arrow welding pig who must protect her piglets from the pack of hungry wolves ballooning up or down the cliff face. The pig is suspended in a winch-controlled cage and must move vertically up and down, shooting the balloons and sending the wolves plummeting to the ground. Any wolves she misses will, having safely reached the ground, climb a ladder to try and bite her. Also, if any of the wolves reach the ground, more piglets will be captured by them. Mother Pig must try to kill as many wolves as possible without letting them reach the ground.

On the second level, the wolves use balloons to float upwards to the top of a high cliff. If enough of them reach the cliff, they will push a huge boulder down onto Mother Pig's cage. After this level has been completed, the piglets who have been captured are rescued and the game starts over with increased difficulty.

There is also a bonus round where Mother Pig will attempt to eliminate as many wolves on ascending balloons as possible by throwing as few slabs of meat as possible for a maximum bonus score."

Ships have been mysteriously disappearing in the vicinity of the Bahamas for years. Now, in 1930, the United States government sends an expedition to the area in a flying boat to determine the cause. As they survey the ocean, the expedition comes across an uncharted landmass which they dub ""Greenhell Isle"" and launches two reconnaissance biplanes to take a closer look. As they investigate the island, the biplanes come under attack by dinosaurs and other life forms that were thought to have become extinct millions of years ago. 

The player takes control of a biplane armed with a forward-firing machine gun. It can also be equipped with an option weapon pod that can be rotated clockwise around the craft. The option's attack changes depending on where it is currently positioned:

* When directly above or below the plane, the option fires energy waves that reflect back upon contact with a surface.
* When diagonally above the plane, the option fires balls of energy that bounce off surfaces at a 45 degree angle.
* When diagonally below the plane, the option drops bombs.
* When directly in front of the plane, the option replaces the default machine gun with its own flame cannon.
* When directly behind the plane, the option deploys aerial mines."

3019;puckmana;puckman;"Puckman (c) 1980 Namco.
";"Puckman is the seminal and hugely influential arcade game in which the player guides the legendary Puckman around a single-screen maze eating dots. Puckman is constantly pursued in his task by four colored ghosts. Each ghost has its own unique personality and behavioural patterns and a single touch from any of the ghosts results in Puckman losing a life. When all of Puckman's lives are lost, the game is over.

Power pills are situated in each corner of the rectangular maze and eating one of these makes Puckman temporarily invincible; the four ghosts also change to dark blue in color and can now be eaten by Puckman. But watch out...a flashing blue ghost indicates that the power pill is about to wear off and the ghosts are about to transform back to their former selves again. Once Puckman eats a blue ghost, this 'skinned' ghost then becomes visible as a pair of eyes only, will return to the ghost pen in the middle of the maze, regenerate into its former self, and return to the maze to continue its pursuit of Puckman. 

Each maze contains 240 dots and 4 power pills, and all must be eaten to complete the level; whereupon the entire sequence begins again with an increased level of difficulty (the action increases in speed and power pills decrease in effectiveness). 

Twice in every level, a bonus fruit or prize item will temporarily appear in the middle of the maze below the ghost pen. Puckman can eat these bonus items to receive extra points. Also, there is an escape tunnel on each side of the maze that Puckman can use to escape any ghosts that are currently closing in on him. The ghosts can also use the tunnel, but take longer to pass through it than Puckman, making escape a little easier. 

Between certain rounds, funny intermissions will be played featuring Puckman and the ghosts in funny situations. Three intermissions are present: 
1) The red ghost chases Puckman across the screen and off the side. Then he re-appears running in the opposite direction, having turned blue, followed by a giant Puckman! This intermission is played after Round 2. 
2) The red ghost is again chasing Puckman, but this time he rips his red sheet on a nail on the ground, and we can see his pink body under the sheet! This intermission is played after Round 5. 
3) The red ghost chases Puckman across the screen once more, this time with his sheet sewn. They disappear at the left side and then the ghost reappears coming back the opposite direction. This time he is bare and drags his sheet behind him. This intermission is played after Rounds 9, 13 and 17.

You should also watch out for ""force-field"" walls - they will kill your tank if it gets caught in one. If you shoot the Pulsar, it will explode into six enemies. 

You will also have to collect the colored keys to open the numbered locks at the bottom of the maze - you will receive a double-points bonus if you do it in numerical order, but regardless of whether you opened those locks in numerical order or not, you will always receive a bonus for how much fuel you have left at this point.

";"The Punisher is a side-scrolling beat-em-up based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, in which one or two players take on the role of either 'The Punisher' or 'Nick Fury' and must battle through six dangerous locales filled with violent criminal gangs, leading to a final confrontation with criminal mastermind, 'The Kingpin'.

As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's energy is lost. Energy levels can be replenished by finding food that lies hidden in some of the background objects that litter the levels.

Many enemies carry weapons, such as axes, baseball bats, swords and knives and should players manage to knock these from the enemies' hands, the heroes can pick up the weapons and use them against the enemies. In keeping with their comic book counterparts, each player character also carries a handgun; this only comes into play when confronted with gun-wielding enemies, at which point the players' guns are drawn automatically. Once the gun-carrying enemies have been killed, the players' guns are automatically re-holstered.

A large and powerful gang boss awaits the heroes at the end of each stage. The five gang bosses are Scully, Guardroid, Bonebreaker, Bushwacker and Guardroid 2. The sixth and final level takes place in The Kingpin's lair, ending with a showdown with the criminal mastermind himself."

";"This is a puzzle game in which the aim is to move symbol-bearing blocks onto identically-symboled blocks in order to eliminate them. Blocks can only be moved left or right, or dropped downwards. 

The order in which the blocks are eliminated needs careful planning, as it's sometimes necessary to destroy three blocks at a time, or use blocks as bridges for other blocks. Some puzzle screens have moving background blocks that act as elevators, making careful timing essential. 

Should the player make a mistake and destroy or move the wrong blocks, each puzzle screen allows for a set number of 'retries' (depending on the dipswitch settings). A retry resets all tiles to their original positions. 

The game consists of eight levels, with each level consisting of four separate puzzle screens. Once a level has been completed, players can chose which level to tackle next. This translates into 36 separate puzzle screens to be completed in any one game, chosen from a total of 144 puzzle screens, giving the game much replay value."

";"The object of the Q*bert game is to change the color of the top of the cubes to the Destination Color indicated at the upper-left corner of the screen (below Player 1's score) by hopping onto them. When all the cubes in the pyramid have been changed to the Destination Color, the screen will advance to the next round, with the player-controlled Q*bert character starting back on the top cube. At the beginning of each level, there will be a short demonstration cycle with Q*bert hopping around four cubes to explain to the player the play action of each level. Each level consists of four rounds. The current level number and round number is displayed at the upper-right corner of the screen (below Player 2's score in a 2-player game).

Gameplay starts with Q*bert appearing at the top of the pyramid. The joystick will move Q*bert from cube to cube by hopping in any of four diagonal directions. Q*bert can move anywhere on the pyramid, but jumping off will kill him. Hopping onto a rotating disk will take Q*bert back to the top of the pyramid. In the first two rounds of play, Q*bert will have to avoid touching the red and purple balls. These deadly objects drop randomly onto the second-from-the-top row of the pyramid and bounce downwards. The red balls will fall off the bottom, but the purple ball will stop at the bottom and hatch into Coily, the snake which chases Q*bert. To get rid of Coily, lure him to the edge, then jump unto a disk. The disk will take Q*bert back to the top and Coily will fall off, awarding 500 points and clearing the board of all other 'nasty' characters.

Starting at the third round of play, other 'nasty' characters come into play. The green characters or objects are safe to hop onto and will award points. All other 'nasty' characters are deadly to touch. In the third round the red balls will stop falling, but two purple characters named Ugg and Wrong Way will appear at the lower portion of the pyramid and travel sideways and upwards (Ugg is the one with the snout moving from right to left on the right face of the cubes, and Wrong Way is the one with the big eyes moving from left to right on the left face of the cubes). They will not chase Q*bert, but will move randomly to get in Q*bert's way. In the third round and every round after, based on an internal timer, a green ball will appear and bounce down from the top of the pyramid. Hopping Q*bert onto the green ball will award 100 points, and freeze all the 'nasty' characters on the screen for a few seconds, but 'Q*bert' will still be able to move to complete the color changes.

During the fourth round of play, two green characters named Slick and Sam will appear, based on the internal timer (Slick is the one wearing shades; Sam does not wear shades, otherwise their function is identical). They will drop onto the second-from-the-top row of the pyramid and hop randomly downwards. If they hop onto a cube that Q*bert has already changed the color of, the cube will change to a different color to thwart Q*bert. Hopping Q*bert onto Slick or Sam will stop them and award 300 points.

Throughout the remaining rounds, all the characters and objects will appear in random combinations with increasing speed.

To add variety to the game, the Flying Discs will change positions every round, and in the higher levels the number of Flying Discs will change.

During Level 2, the play action will increase in difficulty from changing the cubes to one color, to changing the color of the cubes twice. This means that each cube would have to be hopped on twice to change the pyramid to the Destination Color, completing the Round.

Starting at Level 3 and for all remaining rounds, and levels, the play action will become more difficult. The object remains to change the cubes to the Destination Color, but if Q*bert hops on any cube, that cube will change color. So even if the cube has already been changed to the Destination Color, it will change again.

Here is a rundown of how all the colors change :

Legend :
S - Starting Color
I - Intermediate Color
D - Destination Color

LEVEL 1 : When Q*bert jumps on S or I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D (NOTE : During the fourth round, when Slick/Sam jumps on D, it changes to I).

LEVEL 2 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D.

LEVEL 3 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again.

LEVEL 4 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to I. Q*bert must start again.

LEVEL 5 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again.

LEVELS 6-9 : Same color pattern as Level 5. The difference is the increased speed of Q*bert and the 'nasty' characters.

There are also bonus points awarded at the end of each round for successfully completing the round. The bonus for the completion of the 1st round is 1,000 points. This Bonus will progressively increase each Round by 250 points to a maximum of 5,000 points at Level 5."

";"The object of Q*bert's Qubes is to jump around diamond formation of 25 cubes and rotate them so that one or more rows of cubes match the shown target cube (a tic-tac-toe) while avoiding the meltniks, the rat and the purple guys. Jumping on anything green is safe, catching the turtle slows down enemies for a short time and catching the freeze ball freezes enemies for a short time.

Each level has four rounds and a bonus round and there are 11 levels...
Level 1 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes only have 2 colors
Level 2 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes only have 3 colors
Level 3 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes have 6 colors from this point on
Level 4 : get 2 tic-tac-toes
Level 5 : get 3 tic-tac-toes
Level 6 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, matched target cubes can be rotated

Stix are simply lines traced out by moving the marker. When the marker traces out a closed shape, the area enclosed by the shape becomes solid and has been claimed. The player may draw either Fast Stix, which appear blue when solid, or Slow Stix, which appear red. Slow Stix take longer to draw, but are worth twice as many points.

";"As captain of the Sonic Spaceport, players must defend their station against enemy spaceships called Gamma Raiders, which attack with vengeance and swiftly retreat to formation. The object of the game is to destroy 48 enemy Gamma Raiders before there is total disintegration of all the Spaceports on the player's side.

Players can counterattack with the Rapid-Fire Laser Blaster which zooms the lasers over the three-dimensional-esque field of curving vectors, while it intercepts enemies. The lower on the radar screen that you destroy a Gamma Raider, the more points will be earned. If exploding decoys damage the Sonic Spaceport, the Laser Blaster's firing speed will reduce. The Laser Blaster's ""Damage Meter"" will light up as damage is incurred and when fully illuminated, will weaken the Laser Blaster's offensive powers. To reverse this, the players must attack and destroy all remaining Gamma Raiders.

Players are given a wide range of flexibility in controlling the difficulty levels of the game. Extra Spaceports are awarded at 7,000, 10,000, 15,000 and 20,000 points, as determined by the players. The initial number of Spaceports may also be pre-programmed at 3, 4, 5 or 6. When the required number of spaceships is destroyed, players receive an extra point bonus."

";"Another in the long line of ground-breaking racing games from Sega, Rad Mobile is a twenty stage race across America; starting in Los Angeles and finishing in New York. With the game's release, Sega yet again introduced new gameplay elements to the genre, primarily in the form of dynamic weather effects. Sega's 1989 racer, ""Turbo Out Run"", also included limited weather effects, but they were far less prominent as a gameplay feature and a good deal less impressive than they are here.

Another Sega innovation is that many of Rad Mobile's stages have banked corners; with the car's cockpit view tilting to match the driving surface. Some stages also have police patrols, and players must either avoid or outrun the police cars or risk being pulled over. Being pulled over will result in a loss of valuable seconds.

In addition to the tight time limit, rival drivers (represented as red cars) and heavy, two-way traffic, players now had to contend with heavy rain, thick fog and darkness. Windscreen wipers and headlights had to be manually switched on by the player which, together with the first-person in-car view, gave a more realistic and interactive feel to standard but undeniably superb racing action."

";"This is an interesting take on the shooter genre, with three unique sections in each stage. You control a tire with the ability to jump and shoot. When you jump, you can only be hit by the enemies in the first stage.

In the first level, you need to dodge or jump over rocks as bat-like enemies rush down the screen, weaving across it. Occasionally a string of enemies will appear that give a bonus of 1000 if you hit them all. You can also pick up bonus items worth 300 points each.

In the second level, you are driving down a busy road. You need to doge cars as they erratically move across the screen. Occasionally an ambulance will drive up the screen, and if it hits a vehicle it will go flying across the screen. Watch out for the blue trucks in this section. Midway through this part, a green truck appears which drops stars. They are worth 500 each. There are broken down vehicles on the road, along with oil slicks. The pickups worth 300 points make a return.

The third level is a bonus round. You continue driving down the road, but now there are only oil slicks. You need to collect as many point pickups as possible. If you die in this section, it jumps to the next level, and you do not lose a life. You get a bonus if you get every pickup. You are then given a bonus based on your time for the last stage.

There is a difficulty spike at the third stage. The extra life is at 50000. You only get one extra life during the course of the game. The game is infinite."

In-game opponents consist of red enemy cars that try to ram into and destroy the player's car, a problem compounded by the fact that enemy cars are faster than the player's. A smoke screen can be activated which trails behind the player's car and causes any pursuing enemies to crash.

";"Rampage is a classic B-movie inspired smash-em-up in which up to three players take on the roles of three mutated monsters - George the giant ape, Lizzie the giant lizard and Ralph the giant wolf - who move from city to city destroying skyscrapers and vehicles, while eating or killing any people that get in their way. 

The monsters' health can be damaged in a number of ways: by being shot by National Guardsmen, by being hit by another monster, by falling from a building, by being hit by police cars or tanks, by going underwater, by being struck by lightning, or by eating something bad, such as dynamite. Health is replenished by eating food found in damaged buildings. 

If the players' health gauge diminishes completely, the monsters will revert back to their original human form and walk sideways off the screen. Rampage has a ""buy back in"" option, however; if players chose to continue the game before the human figure leaves the play area, the game will continue from that stage. 

Rampage is set over the course of 128 days in cities across North America. The game starts in Peoria, Illinois and ends in Plano, Illinois. In Plano, players receive a mega vitamin bonus which heals all the monsters and provides a large point bonus. After this, the cycle of cities repeats five times. After 768 days, the game resets back to Day One. 

* Examples of bonuses and hazards found inside damaged buildings: 
Food: Milk, Turkey, Hot Toast, Fruit 
Bonus: Flower Pot, TV Set, Money Bag 
Hazard: Cactus, Poison, Toaster 

* Examples of bonuses and hazards found outside damaged buildings: 
Bonus: Auto (or Truck), Commuter Train, Person in Manhole 
Hazard: National Guard Tank, Police Car, Storm Cloud 

Further bonus points can be earned by grabbing a fleeing 'Townie' from a building window. This has two benefits: 1) While holding the Townie, all swat team members disappear from the building windows and 2) accumulating points are scored during the time the Townie is held."

The player is provided with a powerful ship called the RVA-818 X-LAY, which is outfitted with two weapons: a primary weapon that fires straight lasers and increases in power when the player accumulates power-ups, and a secondary lock-on missile launcher, which can also be increased in power, that can target up to eight enemies at once by moving the targeting reticle. This weapon is used to attack enemies that appear on a lower plane than that of your aircraft, which are inaccessible to the player's primary weapon. 

The plot centers in the distant future, human governments, across the planet Earth, construct a massive supercomputer, named ""Con-Human"". The purpose of this computer is to govern the planet's environmental systems, verifying proper nutrients and care is provided to ensure the culture of humans and animal alike.

However, disaster strikes when, after a cloned human's mind is linked with the system, Con-Human becomes sentient and insane. It begins to induce calamities across the planet, constructing corrupt clones of existing organisms, destroying its human masters and exterminating the nature it was intended to protect, apparently intending to replace everything with what Con-Human considers improved versions of themselves.

After prolonged war, Con-Human has succeeded in exterminating 99.8% of humankind, with the remnants fleeing to space colonies. Meanwhile, Con-Human remakes the very interior of Earth. As a result, Earth, as humanity knew it, has utterly ceased to exist, transformed into a planet-sized mobile fortress that is in fact Con-Human's body. Con-Human intends to use the transformed Earth to seek out and destroy the colonies, erasing all remaining traces of old life from the universe and leaving only the new life that it personally created. Now, taking the full-scale offensive, mankind develops powerful ships, one of them the RVA-818 X-LAY starfighter, to fight the oppressive machine by destroying the now-infected Earth entirely."

3-D follow up to Rayforce featuring a lock-on laser system.

A sequel of RayForce that does not follow the main plot ""Con-Human"" storyline, to this time the plot consists of eight stages taking place between August 4 and August 7, 2219 AD; the first three stages take place on Earth, the last three at the fictional planet Secilia, and two between them in the orbits of Earth and Secilia, respectively. Whereas RayForce players must head toward Earth to destroy it, RayStorm players start at and move away from the planet. The plot of the game is exposed minimally during play, with only dates and place names given at the start of each of its first seven stages. An ""Extra Mode"" included with home versions of the game displays maps before the first seven stages and a closing crawl after completing the game, which further illustrate the plot; the map for the fifth stage, for example, shows that a ""gravity catapult"" at the Moon is used to travel from Earth orbit to Secilia orbit.

In a future where space travel has existed since 2119. Humans explored space, and within 100 years Earth established a twenty-colony Star Federation extending to Orion, with each colony kept under martial law. The colonies then mutinied against the Federation: they took control of the major colony Secilia, formed the Secilia Federation and defeated Earth's forces after many battles. After Earth's surrender, all of its inhabitants had been transferred to the colonies. The Secilia Federation suppressed colonial opposition and sent out a force to destroy the planet completely. However, by then the R-Gray, a aircraft made with parts salvaged from 13 different Secilia ships, is completed and deployed to carry out OPERATION RAYSTORM, a desperate attempt to defend Earth from the Federation."

3189;reactor;reactor;"Reactor (c) 1982 Gottlieb.
";"The player controls a cursor that can move freely within a screen-sized arena, the nuclear reactor. The center contains a sun-type gravitational power source, the slowly overheating reactor core. The surrounding wall or the sun, if touched results in death. The cursor is controlled with a trackball by the player, who has to roll it fast in one direction in order to overcome the momentum of gravitation imposed by the sun. Swarms of enemy objects named after various radioactive particles float around in the reactor arena, obeying simple physical laws. These enemies can freely bounce into the walls at low speeds, have a repulsive force against each other and actively attack the player cursor. Boss types often break up into several smaller particles.

The object is to survive the sun and walls while gaining the highest score possible. It takes a delicate touch. Rather than moving the cursor/avatar left, right, up and down as in many arcade games, it is controlled by gravity and moves freely; with the player only being able to accelerate it rather than control its movements directly. Meanwhile the enemy particles are getting so aggressive that it can get very difficult to avoid being pulled in by the sun or touching a wall.

The basic gameplay consists of accelerating the cursor just at the right times so that it circles the reactor core with enough speed to have control via its own momentum when the enemy particles try to knock it off course, and then to place decoys and actually use the acceleration of the ball itself to knock enemies into control rods, traps or the reactor core. By pressing the primary button the player cursor can go into high power mode, providing higher repulsion of enemies and conversely higher risk to the player.

To ease the task the player also has a certain number of decoys at their disposal. Pressing the secondary button places a decoy to attract the enemies, luring them into two traps in the corners of the screen for bonus points, into destroying reactor rods or directly into the walls to kill them. Destroying a row of reactor rods gives the player one more decoy, as well as resetting the size of the slowly swelling reactor core.

A time limit is enforced by the slowly swelling reactor core, which limits the space to move about in the arena. Although the reactor doesn't actually melt down, the decreasing space provides for gradually increasing difficulty. After defeating the first wave of enemies, the solid reactor core changes into Vortex core, unlike the Protect core, is lethal to touch (thus making such levels significantly harder)."

";"FIRST ATTACK IN DAYLIGHT - BOMBERS IN FORMATION WITH ATTACKING AIRCRAFT. This sequence is introduced both audibly and visually : Red alert. Enemy aircraft approaching. 20 jet fighters approaching. Destroy all fighters by 11:00 hours, or MIRV will be launched.
In this sequence, bombers in formation move from left to right across the screen, and then from right to left, etc. During the attack, some break formation and attack the launcher. The aircraft drop bombs in an attempt to hit the launcher. Also during the attack, a special red colored aircraft flying above the aircraft formation appears and drops a red colored megaton bomb that slowly descends on the country. When hours reach 11:00, present fighter attack is interrupted by a flashing CAUTION on screen, followed by appearance of the MIRV.
The MIRV slowly descends, then breaks up into several bombs. They, in turn, also break up into several bombs. As a result, a shower of bombs slowly descends on the country.
Player participation during the attack is to destroy all aircraft by firing rocket launcher. During the attack, player is to avoid direct hits by bombs - each of which costs him one rocket launcher. Also during the attack, the player must destroy the red bomb before it lands, or one rocket launcher is destroyed.
When MIRV appears, player must destroy it completely - otherwise the landing of any one will cost the player one launcher.

SECOND ATTACK BY HELICOPTERS - DROPPING PARACHUTE BOMBS. Introduced by : Helicopter squadron attacking! Destroy helicopters by 16:00 hours, or MIRV will be launched.
Player participation during attack is to destroy all aircraft by firing rocket launcher. During the attack, player is to keep his launcher away from red areas created by exploding bombs - or lose a launcher. Both helicopters and bombs may be destroyed by rockets. However, if the parachute, but not the bomb, is hit, the deflated parachute will drop the bomb much faster.
MIRV attack, if launched, is a repeat of the first sequence above.

THIRD ATTACK AT NIGHT - HEAVY BOMBERS IN FORMATION. Introduced by : Red alert.  Night attack by bombers.
The player is aided by two searchlights. The object is to destroy all aircraft. When all aircraft are destroyed, game progresses to next frame (country). During the attack, the player must avoid direct hits by bombs. No time limit is imposed. No MIRV will be launched.

GAME FRAMES. Game repeats above cycles through the following countries, respectively : FRANCE, USA, ITALY, GREAT BRITAIN, GERMANY, and JAPAN. However, as the game progresses from frame to frame, the action of the game is stepped up.

HOW LAUNCHERS ARE LOST. Rocket launchers are lost by :
* A direct hit by a dropped bomb
* Red bomb dropped by red plane lands anywhere
* Launcher is in red area created by exploding parachute bomb
* MIRV lands anywhere"
3193;redbaron;redbaron;"Red Baron (c) 1980 Atari, Incorporated.
";"Red Baron is a realistic flying simulation. Your player is a World War I fighter pilot searching the skies for the enemy. The horizon shifts and tilts as he maneuvers the joystick. Three dimensional hills and valleys sweep by below.

Suddenly out of the horizon, an enemy biplane appears. The pilot dives, climbs, lines up the plane in his sights! He fires a deadly hail of tracers and the enemy airplane tumbles to earth.

But watch out, there are more coming. The first four planes are relatively slow. As time progresses, the player moves more quickly and the enemy planes take more evasive action, adding to the difficulty and challenge.

Next the player faces ground targets. An observation blimp floats into view over a low rise of hills. Bright ground objects start to appear, a tank, a pill-box, then dimmer targets, a pyramid, a building. They make good targets for strafing runs but danger can appear at any time.

As the game progresses, tanks, pill-boxes and blimps will begin shooting back.  The game is composed of randomly alternating series of ground and plane phases. Finally, the planes will also shoot at the player.

There are other dangers too.  Dive too low and the player can crash and explode on a mountain. Squeeze the trigger too long and the guns overheat. And an enemy plane can get on the pilot's tail, almost certain death unless the player is a flying ace.

When a player is hit by a returning plane, bullet holes and cracks appear on the screen, his plane plummets to earth and explodes. If an enemy shell finds its mark, the result is the same but the shell remains visible."

Later levels also have enemy subs and ships all intent on foiling the rescue mission. Players must be careful to avoid the falling wreckage of any enemy helicopters they have just destroyed, and also need to be wary of hitting any parachuting airmen with their 'copter blades, as this will kill the airmen instantly.

In a very similar vein to Williams' legendary ""Robotron"", also released in '82, the rescue chopper is armed with a gun that can fire in eight different directions, irrespective of the direction the rescue chopper is flying in. In addition to the eight-way gun, the 'copter can also drop missiles from its underside, which is essential for destroying enemy subs and ships.

3218;ribbit;ribbit;"Ribbit! (c) 1991 Sega.
";"Ribbit! is a one or co-operative two-player abstract arcade game and is an unofficial sequel to Konami's seminal 1981 release, ""Frogger"".

Unlike its legendary prequel (in which players had to guide a frog to his home at top of each screen without being killed) the aim here is to guide a toad around a screen, eating benign insects - such as Ants and Dragon-flies - while avoiding harmful ones - such as Spiders and Rats. A level is only complete once a set amount of insects have been eaten.

Ribbit's stages take place over a number of different locations, including a sandy desert, a beach and - in tribute to the original game - on a fast flowing river with logs and turtles acting as platforms.

Bonus points are awarded if a stage is completed within 60 seconds - with the amount earned dictated by how quickly the stage is completed. A bonus round also appears after every third stage, in which players must run over as many of either flowers or mushrooms as possible to make them bloom."

It has also been discovered that Paul's girlfriend has been kidnapped by the syndicate and must be rescued.

MID's hideout is located on Riot Island, an island full of abandoned, run-down buildings that has since become a slum. Locations include apartments, a hospital, a factory and a casino.

Riot City is practically a direct copy of Capcom's superb 'Final Fight', with both gameplay and graphical style heavily copied from the 1989 classic. One gameplay difference is that Riot City does not allow players to pick up and use weapons as they can in Final Fight, although bonus items found in various containers can be collected."

3243;ripoff;ripoff;"Rip Off (c) 1980 Cinematronics.
";"RIP OFF is a 1- or 2-player action game that offers features guaranteed to capture and prolong player interest : an accelerating competitive level with a clearly visible object and a team competition option that allows players to combine scores as well as skills in defense strategy against a futuristic enemy.

The center of the playfield is occupied by a selectable number of triangular fuel cells that pulsate with radioactive energy. The player commandeers a land craft that turns left, right, accelerates and fires torpedo energy bursts activated by push-buttons mounted on the ""bridge"" control panel. All is quiet as the background audio repeats an ominous low frequency tone. Suddenly, alien craft enter in waves from the edges of the playfield attempting to attach their vehicles to the fuel cells and drag them off to restock their own dwindling supplies. The player maneuvers his land ship into position and fires a volley of torpedoes at the first invader, causing his vehicle to explode in a thunderous roar and a flash of light. A second invader retaliates by firing short range laser bursts at the defender ship while a third invader escapes, dragging off a precious fuel cell. The background audio quickens its pitch and tempo as another wave of sleeker, faster invaders attack and maneuver to rip off fuel canisters - and the battle rages on!

GAME PLAY

The 1-player mode is activated when a coin is accepted and the player pushes the 1-player button. As play begins the first player's vehicle appears on the right side of the screen and moves slightly forward. The enemy vehicles then appear in pairs from various points on the edge of the screen and gravitate toward the player and the triangles. The enemies fire lasers while they move. The player scores points by either shooting the enemy or colliding with him before the enemy can shoot the player, collide with him or drag his triangle off the screen. When a player's vehicle is exploded, it reappears on the right side of the screen where it began.

When a player has sufficient points to achieve a bonus level, the enemies will appear three at a time instead of in pairs and their point value increases. Each bonus level increases the enemies' point value, as well as their ability to seek out and destroy the player. When all the triangles have been dragged off the screen, the game is over and the unit reverts to attract mode.

The 2-player mode is activated when two coins have been accepted and a player pushes the two player button. As play begins, the first player's vehicle appears on the right side of the screen and the second player's vehicle appears on the left. Both vehicles move forward slightly. Enemy vehicles then appear in groups of three and attack the players and seek to drag off the triangles. Players score points by colliding with the enemy vehicles or shooting them. No points are scored by shooting or colliding with the other player. Should the players' ships collide, an explosion will occur and the players' vehicles will reappear at the points where they began.

In the 2-player operator selectable opponent mode, individual scores are displayed after each wave of attackers are destroyed or successfully leave the screen. In the team mode, the combined score of both defenders is displayed. At the end of the game, when all fuel canisters have been removed, the individual high score for the day is displayed at the bottom of the screen and the high team score is displayed at the top.

A player achieves bonus levels in which the value of each invader vehicle is increased by the displayed amount of the bonus. There are six different types of invader vehicles, each wave becoming increasingly offensive and more difficult to destroy. The point bonus is in effect after six waves, the full compliment of ship types, have been destroyed. There are three similar craft in a wave, and in the two player mode twelve waves must be eliminated before bonus goes into effect.

There are no time units per game credit, and the battle goes on until all fuel canisters have been ""ripped off"" from the playfield. The length of play is solely dependent upon the skill of the player - but it takes an experienced, practiced captain to hold off the swift invaders for long!"

YOU determine the strategies he will use to defeat the evil monster VOLTAR who has invaded the Earth, stealing all types of treasures and burying them deep within the earth. VOLTAR also takes hostages and seals them in vaults deep within the earth.

There is only one way to save the hostages and recover the stolen treasures. We must send in ROTO. He will follow VOLTAR right into his own home tunnels to rescue the hostages and recover the stolen treasures VOLTAR has salted away.

To say the least, this makes VOLTAR more than just a little bit upset with ROTO. To help protect his stolen treasures and kidnapped hostages. VOLTAR has developed a breed of giant SPIDER that can sense ROTO's location and that can also travel through solid earth. These SPIDERS attempt to corner and capture ROTO. And to direct their hunt for ROTO, VOLTAR turns himself into a TROLL that can travel through solid earth.

If and when ROTO is captured by the SPIDERS or the TROLL, he is forcibly ejected from VOLTAR’s tunnels and you loose one player.

As your skill level increases and you get into the higher racks of the game, the ability of the SPIDERS and the TROLL to sense ROTO's location increases. This makes ROTO's chances of survival considerably smaller And VOLTAR, being what he is, has reinforcements in the form of a set of disembodied TEETH that he can call on to help him track ROTO down and put the bite on him. These TEETH also have the ability to travel through solid earth.

ROTO has no reinforcements he can call on to help him defend himself against his enemies. He has ONLY YOUR SKILL at maneuvering and forming strategies plus one use of the MAGIC button (which makes ROTO and any hostages he has with hlm invisible to all monsters for a short period of time) per rack to keep him safe as he carries out his rescue missions.

Bonus ROTOs are awarded to you periodically throughout the game: after you complete every third rack of the game. Each recaptured treasure and rescued hostage has an assigned point value as listed below. In the 2 times and 3 times racks, the values of all items are doubled or tripled respectively."

In addition to his default gun, Robo-Kid is able collect powerups for a shield that activates on enemy contact, rapid fire, and speed powerups. The player can also encounter a friendly dinosaur-looking robot that sells weapons and shields to Robo-kid using extra lives as currency."
3281;robotbwl;robotbwl;"Robot Bowl (c) 1977 Exidy.
";"You have a top down view of a bowling alley with score cards shown on each side. The only thing in the game that uses an actual animation is the bowler himself, the robot has a several frame animation when he walks. Everything is (of course) shown in glorious monochrome black and white. The game begins with your robot bowler running up to the alley (his feet move faster than he does, which makes it look like he is running on a conveyor belt or something). You then have three seconds to roll the ball, before it will roll of its own accord. The game is controlled with five buttons, they are left, right, shoot, hook left, and hook right. When Exidy was making this game, they had to make a decision about how the hooking worked, and it seems that they decided that ""Robots are telepaths, and can effect the balls movement after it is thrown!"". You see you can't even hook the ball until after it is thrown. This makes it very easy to pick up the spare. The game makes up for that little trick by making 'splits' very common (the 7-10 split and the 4-7-10 split come up all the time). These are pretty annoying, but you can usually learn how to clear them out (except the 7-10 split, I still haven't figured out how to clear that one)."
3282;robotron;robotron;"Robotron: 2084 (c) 1982 Williams.
";"Set in the year 2084, Robotron is a single-screen shoot-em-up in which super-intelligent self-aware robots known as 'Robotrons' - designed and built to help mankind - have revolted against their creators and vowed to either reprogram the humans into Robotrons or, failing this, wipe-out the human race entirely. 

The player must destroy the robots and rescue the Earth's remaining human families. The player's only weapon is a multi-directional Anti-Robot Laser Gun. Used effectively, it will give players the power to destroy all the Robot waves, with the exception of the indestructible 'Hulk' unit. 

At the start of the attack wave, players will have three chances to wipe out the enemy and advance to the next wave. Every 25,000 points players are granted another chance to complete their mission. 

MAN, WOMAN, CHILD: These are the only three types of human clones left on Earth. Defenseless and easy prey to the Robots, they are totally dependent upon players for their survival and will wander aimlessly until the player makes contact with them. Touching them will place them under the player's protective powers and earn them the following points: 1,000 for rescuing the 1st human; 2,000 for the 2nd: 3,000 for the 3rd; 4,000 for the 4th; 5,000 for the 5th; and 5,000 for every additional human saved. At the beginning of each new wave and when the player loses a turn, rescue scoring will again begin at 1,000.

TANK: Its goal is to kill the player by firing rebounding Shells. Annihilate the Tank for 300 points; the Shell for 50 points. 

BRAIN: Red alert. The Brain is the most clever and dangerous of the Robot species. Its two-pronged attack will be launched every fifth wave. If it collides with the player, it will electrocute them where they stand. It also possesses the devastating power to fire Cruise Missiles which will follow the player until either contact is made or they are shot and destroyed. Kill the Brain for 500 points; demolish the Cruise Missile for 75 points. 

The victims of the second prong of the Brain's attack are the defenseless humans. If captured, a human will be irreversibly transformed - literally re-programmed by the Brain's incredible mind powers - into a Prog: a Robot that will viciously turn against its own protector, the player. Annihilate the Progs for 100 points or meet a violent death at their hands. 

SPHEROID: This pulsating sphere may at first look harmless, but it is the mothership which spawns deadly Enforcer Embryos. Players must try to explode the Spheroid before it ejects the Embryos to earn 1,000 points. 

ENFORCER: The Embryos grow into evil Enforcers. Kill them for 200 points. Let them live and they will lessen the player's chance for survival by launching Enforcer Sparks. Destroy the Sparks for 25 points. 

HULK: In all attack waves except every fifth, the Hulk will stalk his prey. He alone of the Robot species cannot be killed. The player's Laser Gun can only slow him down or divert him from his objective of crushing all life from the humans and the player. Players must avoid this Robot at all costs or the mission will be lost at the outset. 

GRUNT: The least sophisticated species of Robot is the Grunt. He has no weapon and possesses only minimal intelligence. This does not mean he is to be dealt with lightly. He will single-mindedly pursue players to capture and destroy them. Kill him and score 100 points. 

ELECTRODES: The pulsating, immobile Electrodes will attempt to block the player's path. A collision with them means instant death. Fortunately, the Grunts will also be annihilated by contact with the player. Electrodes must be avoided or destroyed with the Laser Gun. In each new attack wave they will assume a different shape, but remain just as deadly if contact is made."

3289;rocnrope;rocnrope;"Roc'n Rope (c) 1983 Konami.
";"Roc'n Rope is an incredibly difficult yet playable platform game featuring four different levels. The player takes on the role of a an archaeologist whose mission is to return the missing tail feathers to the golden Phoenix. The archaeologist is armed with a harpoon gun and uses it to fire a rope into a platform above, in order to climb up the rope and progress up the level. This is vaguely similar to the superb 'telescopic arm' feature that appeared in Capcom's superb ""Bionic Commando"".

All levels are patrolled by enemies in the form of dinosaurs and cavemen and all are deadly to the touch. Some cavemen will pull on the harpoon rope while the archaeologist is climbing it. This will result in the player falling from the rope and losing a life. The archaeologist is armed with a light ray that will kill the enemies.

A breakdown of the game's four levels :

* The first level is possibly the most difficult in the game. Players begin at the bottom left of the screen and must work their way up to the Roc, who is sitting at the upper right of the screen. There are many layers of ledges coming out from the sides of the screen. While the middle of the screen is open to the sky (except for a few floating platforms). To reach the top, players must use the harpoon gun to climb diagonally back and forth until they reach the top (ensuring that the Phoenix feathers have been collected on the way).

* The second level is set underground. There are a lot of dinosaurs on this screen and far fewer platforms than on the first level. Many of the platforms stretch completely across the screen, so there aren't many pitfalls to be wary of. Once again, players must get the archaeologist to the top of the screen to complete the level.

* The third level is set outdoors. A 'ferris wheel' style rotating platform sits in the center of the screen, but this can be avoided if players don't wish to use it. The easiest route to the top is on the right-hand side of the level.

* The fourth and final level is shaped a little like a mountain. The player's main concern here is a large waterfall in the center of the screen. Players must time their harpoon climb just right to avoid being killed by the deadly waters. Once this level is finished, the game starts over with an increased level of difficulty."

";"Rod-Land is a cute and colourful platform game for one or two players in which two fairy sisters - 'Tam' and 'Rit' - must rescue their kidnapped mother from the 'Maboots Tower' fortress.

The fairies are armed with the 'Rods of Sheesanomo' - two magical rods that enable the fairies to catch enemies in a force-field and slam them into the platforms to kill them - and must clear each level of enemies to move onto the next and eventually reach and infiltrate the Tower.

As well as the magical rods used for attacking enemies, the fairies can also create a magical ladder - in a fashion very similar to that used in Taito's ""Rainbow islands"" - which can be utilised anywhere on a level and allows players to reach other platforms or escape from pursuing enemies. Each player can utilise only one magically-created ladder at any one time and the creation of a new ladder removes the previously-created one.

A level is only completed when all enemies have been killed. Some defeated enemies drop bonus items, such as fruit, missiles and bombs.

Each of the game's levels features brightly coloured flowers. If players manage to collect all of these, the 'Extra Game' mode begins. During this time-limited mode all of the level's enemies turn red and move much faster. If the enemies are killed in time, they drop an alphabetic letter that can be collected to spell the word 'EXTRA' and earn players an extra life."

The red car is controlled by the joystick feature, and is pursued through 16 different routes (mazes) by three chase cars. The search mode reveals an overview of all 16 routes, and the search mode appears whenever the car exits a route. In the search mode, the player car becomes a red cube, and the chase cars become yellow cubes.

Whenever the player car exits one route, there is a one second delay for a total overview of the game.

Each route has dead-ends, zig-zags, and multiple entrances and exits.

Some routes have the dollar symbol ($), and the player scores 200 points each time this symbol is cleared. The dollar symbols randomly chance to oil slicks, and when encountered, the oil slicks slow down the player car.

The question mark symbol (?) is surrounded by check points and will either reveal a bomb symbol or a bell mark after the player car clears the check point. The bell will add 800 points to the player's score when cleared. Player skill is tested here to avoid the bomb if it appears.

Some routes have a flag symbol, and when the player car clears the symbol, the pursuing cars become dollar symbols, and every effort should be made by the player to chase them down, and add extra points to his score.

One route has a flickering bonus car symbol. When the symbol appears, clear it and earn an additional player car.

One route has an additional game feature. When the player car enters the maze, it is pursued by an attacking monster. The player car cannot clear or collide with the monster, but must avoid it, or be destroyed.

The high-speed button is another feature of Route 16. When pushed, the player car is accelerated to escape the chase cars. Usage of the high-speed button reduces the player car's fuel. At the end of each round, bonus points are added to the player's score for remaining fuel.

After all the symbols are cleared, the round ends. In successive rounds, additional dollar symbols ($), and additional enemy chase cars are added."

";"Route 16 is a challenging race car game, integrating special features to excite the beginner as well as the seasoned player. The vivid video screen is fascinating, and is complimented by exceptional audio during game play.

The red car is controlled by the joystick feature, and is pursued through 16 different routes (mazes) by three chase cars. The search mode reveals an overview of all 16 routes, and the search mode appears whenever the car exits a route. In the search mode, the player car becomes a red cube, and the chase cars become yellow cubes.

Whenever the player car exits one route, there is a one second delay for a total overview of the game.

Each route has dead-ends, zig-zags, and multiple entrances and exits.

";"Rolling Thunder is a single-player scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which a James Bond-esque secret agent codenamed 'Albatross' has been ordered by the Rolling Thunder anti-espionage unit to stop the criminal organization known as Geldra. Albatross must also rescue captured field agent, Lelia Blitz and overthrow Geldra's leader, Maboo.

Rolling Thunder's gameplay takes place on two levels of platforms, with the player able to jump or drop to platforms as and when required. Albatross begins the game armed with only a standard-issue pistol and a limited amount of ammunition. If the pistol's ammunition runs out, the player can only fire a single slow ""chaser"" bullet - with only one allowed on-screen at any one time - until more ammo is acquired.

Each level is littered with doors; most of these contain constantly emerging enemies and must be carefully passed; some, however, also provide ammunition and new weapons. Ammo rooms are clearly marked while weapons rooms have re-enforced metal doors. A weapons room gives the player a fully automatic assault rifle that allows for continuous firing by holding down the shoot button. As with the pistol, the assault rifle has a limited amount of ammunition.

The majority of Rolling Thunder's protagonists are hooded soldiers known as ""Maskers"". Maskers are dressed in various colors, which determines both their strength and attack pattern. Some Maskers do not shoot, but throw grenades instead, while others will shoot their gun while crouching, making their shots much harder to avoid.

Other enemies includes ninjas, mutated bats known as Gelzos, panthers, shrieking yellow creatures known as Blogas and lava men.

Albatross must travel through two different segments or ""stories"" - each composed of five stages - making for a total of ten stages. The stages in Story 2 are essentially a harder version of their Story 1 counterparts, featuring more traps and different enemy placement. At the end of the final stage, the player must battle the Geldra leader Maboo to rescue Leila and complete the mission."

";"R*Type is a sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the evil Bydo Empire rules the galaxy through fear and intimidation and it's up to the player - piloting their heavily-armed R-9 space ship - to battle through eight tough levels to the heart of the Bydo stronghold and defeat them.

The game's revolutionary weapons system is its real stroke of genius. The first of numerous innovations that R*Type bought to the genre is the beam weapon: when the fire button is held down, a 'power meter' starts to charge up; once the meter is full, releasing the fire button unleashes a very powerful plasma burst capable of inflicting much greater damage to enemy ships or even destroying numerous enemies simultaneously. The trade-off is that charging the weapon takes up valuable seconds, giving the Bydo ships time to attack.

The most significant addition to R-type's arsenal is the now-legendary 'Force Pod'. This takes the form of an invincible, detachable laser-firing pod that can be attached to either the front or rear of the player's ship, or can be detached completely, after which the pod sits some distance either ahead or behind the player's ship, tracking its movements and providing additional fire power. When attached to the R9 ship, the pod acts as a shield. This forms a crucial part of R*Type's gameplay and has to be fully utilised to navigate certain sections of the game, such as the huge mothership that comprises the game's 3rd stage.

R*Type's levels are designed to make full use of its unique weapons system, making for very linear and demanding gameplay in which losing or picking up the wrong weapon at the wrong time often leads to an instant death. Its intelligent, precise and demanding level design, gave the world its first truly 'strategic' shoot-em-up."

The innovative weapons system of the original game - the 'Beam Weapon' and 'Force Pod' - make a welcome return and remain unchanged for the sequel.

The tight, demanding gameplay and high emphasis on correct usage of the weapons system also return - although the sequel is, if anything, even more demanding than its already unforgiving predecessor; with more durable enemies and trickier level design. 

R*Type II features three new weapon shot types: 
* Green - Search Laser - fires semi-homing lasers that can bend at 45° angles. 
* Grey - Shotgun Laser - fires large shells that travel a short distance before exploding powerfully. 
* Scatter Bomb - drops bombs to the ground; when these explode, the explosion scatters forwards along the ground. This is a supporting weapon that can be equipped instead of missiles.

In addition to the new weapons, R-type II's Beam Weapon has received an upgrade. As with the first game, holding down the fire button makes a power gauge fill up, releases the button then unleashes a powerful plasma shot. For the sequel, however, continuing to hold down the button causes the gauge to charge up further. This 'double-charged' gauge flashes blue and red and releases an even more powerful plasma burst."

";"R-Type Leo is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up and is the third and final arcade release of this classic series (although numerous console-only sequels would follow, see 'Series' for details).

Mankind are currently at peace with their former adversaries, the Bydo Empire, and have taken the opportunity to undertake a massive project called 'Project Paradise'. This involved the construction of an artificial terrestrial-like planet called 'Eden', created as a safe haven should humanity once again find itself under threat. However, soon after construction is completed, 'Major' - the bio-computer system responsible for maintaining Eden - malfunctions, taking control of the planet's defences and launching an attack on mankind. It is up to the newly-developed 'R-9 Leo' fleet to fly in and stop Major's assault on its creators.

R-Type Leo deviates from the gameplay style of its predecessors by removing the use of both the 'Force Pod' and the 'Wave Cannon'. The new weapons are called 'Force Bits' (later identified in ""R-Type Final"" as ""Psy Bits"") and the 'Bit Shot'. The three 'Force Bit' weapon types are:
* Red - Claw Laser: a powerful horizontal laser beam and horizontal traverse wave
* Blue - Mirror Laser: fires multiple, ricocheting lasers.
* Green - Search Laser LRG: fires semi-homing lasers that can bend at 90 degree angles.

Unlike previous 'Bit' devices, the 'Force/Psy Bits' are capable of firing either forwards or backwards (their direction dictated by the movement of the ship itself). Finally, the 'Wave Cannon' is replaced by a 'Bit Shot', in which the Psy Bits detach from the ship and collide with the nearest enemy. The Bits can only do this for a limited time before running out of energy, and must be recalled to the ship to recharge.

R Type Leo consists of 6 stages and is the first game in the series to allow 2 players to play simultaneously."

";In 1945, the second world war ended. Soon, there was peace, but an organization of high-ranking military officers from all over the world form a global army known as CANY. Their mission was to conquer the world. CANY activity was found in areas like the Soviet Union, America, Japan, and even Germany. It is revealed that CANY had weapons never seen before from rockets to mechanical walkers. The world quickly formed a group of pilots and planes called the Strikers whose mission is to rid of CANY from the world.

";"After inserting quarters and hitting the Start button, the player chooses one of 6 planes (plus 1 hidden plane) or can opt for a random choice.

The available fighters are :
* P-38 Lightning
* Vought XF5U 'Flying Pancake'
* Spitfire Mk. VI
* Zero Type 52
* Focke Wulf Ta 152
* Fiat G.56
* XP-55 Ascender (Hidden) 

The first 4 stages are in random order, while the last 4 are sequential. Players collect weapon powerups, bombs, and gold bars for points. Each plane has a unique 'supershot' which is charged by damaging enemies and fired by holding then releasing the fire button. Supershots can be stored, although the number varies from plane to plane. Using a Bomb results in a large friendly fighter swooping onto the screen and blocking shots while returning fire for a few seconds.

After the player beats the final boss, the game starts again from the beginning, albeit at a much higher difficulty level. All level are similar to the ones in Strikers 1945 II. Only one of the 4 bosses that are randomly chosen and the 6th boss is changed."

";This game was in black and white, not greyscale (like many early games used), but just 2 colors, black and white. But the characters and animals were large, and very detailed for just using a single color. There were 4 different animals that you could hunt. Snakes and lions were both rather slow moving, and good for 100 points each. Wild boars would run quickly across the screen, but would net you 200 for a kill. Finally, vultures were small and would move around erratically near the top of the screen (being worth 300 points if you could hit them). Touching any of the beasties meant instant death, but it mattered little, because this game played on time limits anyway. Death only meant that you would lose a few seconds waiting for your intrepid big game hunter to reappear (the game lasted 90 seconds total).

Salamander introduced further variety to the action with the introduction vertically-scrolling levels, which alternated with the standard side-scrolling levels.

Salamander's weapon power-up system is as follows :
* SPEED UP : Five speed levels.
* MISSILE : Press missile button to launch.
* LASER : Your forward rockets turn into deadly lasers.
* RIPPLE LASER : Use shoot button to fire.
* FORCE FIELD : Protect your ship with barriers.
* MULTIPLE : Increase your fire power by up to four times.

";"Super Breakout allows the player(s) to select any one of three different action-packed Super Breakout games by turning the game select knob on the control panel to the desired game. The three available Super Breakout modes are the following : 

* Double Breakout : before serving the ball, the Double Breakout playfield contains 52 orange bricks (4x13) at the top of the screen and 52 green bricks (4x13) immediately below the orange brick wall. 
Two paddles are displayed at the bottom end of the screen. When the serve pushbutton is pressed two balls are served. If the first ball served is missed, it counts as a missed serve and goes against the players allotted serves per game; otherwise the second ball is served. If the second ball served is missed after striking the first served ball, the player may continue with the first ball. 

* Cavity Breakout : before serving the ball, the Cavity Breakout playfield contains 44 orange bricks and 52 (4x13) green bricks located immediately below the orange brick wall. At approximately 3 columns in and 2 rows down into the orange brick wall, from both the left and the right side of the wall, two cavities appear. These two cavities occupy the space of 4 bricks (a 2x2 brick area). 
One paddle is provided in this game, and only one ball is served, unlike Double Breakout. When enough bricks are removed to release a captive ball from its cavity, the score doubles for each brick removed by any of the two balls in the playfield (as long as the served and freed ball remain active in the playfield). If the third ball is freed and all three balls are played in the playfield, the score triples. If any one of the balls is missed and lost, the score returns to double points. If the second ball is missed and only one ball remains in the playfield, points are then scored as normal. 

* Progressive Breakout : before serving the ball, the Progressive Breakout playfield contains 4x13 brick walls (one blue and the other green). The blue brick wall, which consists of 52 bricks, is at the top. Then occurs a space equivalent to this wall. In the middle of the screen is a green brick wall consisting of 52 bricks. 
The brick walls move or 'scroll' toward the paddle at a rate determined by the number of hits on the ball. As the bricks are knocked out and the walls progressively creep up on the player's paddle, new bricks enter the playfield at a progressively faster rate; four rows of bricks are always separated by four rows of blanks. 
As the brick walls scroll down, their colors change which indicates a new point score for that brick at that instant of time."

3421;scontraj;scontraj;"Super Contra - Alien no Gyakushuu (c) 1988 Konami.
";"The sequel to ""Contra"" - released a year earlier - is set in the year 2634 and begins with the disturbing news that the alien invaders from the first game - a race known as the Red Falcon - have renewed their attack on Earth and have infiltrated military bases and possessed most of the federation forces troops. 

The heroes of the first games - Bill Rizer and Lance Bean - are once again called upon to defend the Earth and defeat the alien invaders. 

Super Contra plays identically to its predecessor, with the usual mix of run-and-gun gameplay. The main difference is that the into-the-screen stages of the original Contra have been replaced with overhead stages. In addition, power-up icons are now represented as the actual weapons wielded by the characters, instead of the traditional letter-based falcon icons and players can now upgrade their weapon by picking it up twice in a row. 

Another new gameplay addition is that players can now control the height of their jump; holding the joystick up and pressing the jump button allows for a higher jump; likewise the player can perform low jumps by holding down-right or down-left while pressing the jump button. 

The available weapons are as follows: 

* Machine Gun - Fires bullets at auto-fire. The upgraded version increases the firing rate to a near-ridiculous speed. 

* Bomb Launcher - Fires bombs that spread fire when they hit their target. The upgraded version causes bigger explosions. 

* Laser Rifle - Fires a powerful laser beam once per shot. The upgraded version fires a larger beam. 

* Spread Shot - Fires a three-way shot. Increases to a five-way spread after the upgrade. 

* Mega Shell - Available only in the top-view stages. After picking it up, players can launch it by pressing the jump button and kill all on-screen enemies. 

Super Contra's five stages are: 

* Area 1 - Outer Base (side-view) - A military base overrun by possessed soldiers. Bosses include a manned tank and a possessed helicopter. At the end of the level, players must destroy a core protected by a pair of snipers and a grenade thrower to gain entrance to the next area. 

* Area 2 - Inner Base (top-view) - A tank hanger filled with manned tanks and cannons, in addition to enemy soldiers. The end-of-level boss is the Hyper Electric Magnetic Tank Magnus, which is manned by three gunners. 

* Area 3 - Jungle (side-view) - Enemies come from trees as players progress through the level. The heroes will sometimes have to cross a lake, and players can duck into it to avoid enemy fire. Towards the end of the level, the heroes are faced with alien eggs that produce facehugger-like creatures (the same ones featured in the original game). The end-of-level boss is an alien shrine with a skull. 

* Area 4 - 1st Alien Lair (side-view) - This takes place inside an alien nest. The enemies are now xenomorph-like creatures and mutant mouths that shoot alien spawns. The sub-boss is an alien hovercraft composed of skulls, while the end-of-level boss is a flying alien. 

* Area 5 - 2nd Alien Lair (top-view) - The final stage, filled with mouths emerging from the ground, flying heads and spider-like creatures. The final boss is Gaver, a giant alien head with snake-like arms."

";"Scramble is a sideways scrolling shoot-em-up in which a single player takes control of a spaceship and must try to fight through six different enemy-packed levels - destroying as many fuel tanks and ground intallations as possible - before reaching the enemy base and destroying it. 

Contact with any scenery, ground installations, enemy ships or projectyles results in an instant loss of life. The Scramble ship is armed with both a blaster and bombs. The blaster is forward-firing only while the bombs drop downwards to target ground-based enemy installations and to collect fuel from fuel dumps. 

The fuel dumps are of particular importance, as the player ship's fuel gauge constantly depletes as the player progresses through the game and the only way to re-fuel is by bombing the fuel tanks that are located on the ground throughout the levels. Fuel usage increases as the game progresses, until fuel usage actually outstrips the amount of fuel dumps available and the game becomes impossible. 

Scramble is rightly considered to be a classic and was the world's first ever 'multi-level' shoot-em-up."

The game is divided into five stages, each consisting of five sections (with the final stage having six sections to accommodate the spare letter).

The controls consists of an eight-way joystick and two buttons, one for shooting and the other for changing the character's aim to the left or right. This allows the player to shoot at one direction while moving away towards the opposite. The player will shoot their rifle towards the left or the right with the fire button, while dropping bombs at the same time to the ground. By destroying certain dome-shaped containers, the player can obtain one of three power-up items represented by letters: S, P, and B.

3437;sdungeon;sdungeon;"Space Dungeon (c) 1981 Taito America Corp.
";"Each level of Space Dungeon consists of 36 rooms arranged in a six-by-six grid. Rooms are connected by open doorways of various sizes. One room in each level is the entrance, where the player begins, and another is the Collect Bonus room. Other rooms may or may not contain laser defenses, hostile aliens, or various bits of treasure. The goal in each level is to navigate using an automap to the room containing the ""Collect Bonus"" area, visiting as many rooms and collecting as much treasure as possible along the way.

The player's only weapon is a laser cannon, which fires a pulsing, solid beam in any of eight directions. Like Robotron: 2084 (1982), but preceding the release of that game, the controls for Space Dungeon are a pair of 8-directional joysticks: one for moving, one for shooting. Space Dungeon may have been the first twin-stick shooter.

Higher scores are awarded for exiting each level with more treasures. A 10,000-point bonus is awarded if the player visits every single room on the level, whether or not all treasures on the level have been collected. Since an extra ship is awarded to the player every 10,000 points, this, and the large point values of the treasures (especially the later ones) created an interesting tension between securing the treasures already collected or risking losing ships to acquire more. If the player's ship collides with an enemy or any of their spore shots before reaching the ""Collect Bonus"" cube, all collected treasure is dropped in the room where the ship was destroyed. This room is designated on the map by an X."

";"Secret Agent is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up which the player takes on the role of a James Bond-esque secret agent who must fight his way through a terrorist group called 'CWD' to reach the final Boss confrontation and prevent a stolen nuclear missile being launched.

The player starts the game armed only with a pistol, and this has a limited amount of ammunition. Once the ammo has run out, players can only kick their enemies. Machine guns are occasionally dropped by defeated enemies and can be picked up and used. Also, Golden Gun components are sometimes dropped; there are six of these in total and once all have been collected, the player is rewarded with a very powerful golden rifle. This weapon kills all enemies instantly but will only last for twenty-five seconds, indicated by a meter at the top-right of the screen.

Most of the game's eight stages are platform-based, but there are also two underwater scuba levels and a motorbike chase. All of the game's end-of-level bosses reappear on the final 'underground lair' level.

While not officially licensed as a James Bond game, Secret Agent is unmistakably meant to represent both the Bond character and movie series. The Bond villain Jaws shows up at the end of stage two and another famous Bond villain, Odd Job also appears. Another memorable Bond reference is the use of a Shaun Connery impersonator who tells players that they have done a Great job upon completion of a level."

The game plays much the same as its prequels, as well as the 'Gradius' series it sets out to parody. One new addition to the game-play is the introduction of branching paths through the game. Each level has a specific task, such as collecting the golden coins on the second level, the completion or failure of which dictates which level players will be faced with next.

Due to the powerful Konami GX hardware the game runs on, Sexy Parodius's colorful and inventive visuals represent the pinnacle of the series."

";"This was the first official sequel to the legendary one-on-one fighting game, Street Fighter II - The World Warrior. 

As with its predecessor, battles take place over a series of 'best two-out-of-three' rounds. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's 'vitality' before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time, or if the timer expires with both fighters having equal amounts of vitality remaining, a 'Double KO' or 'Draw Game"" is declared and additional rounds will be played to sudden death. 

New gameplay additions included the ability to play as any of the four boss characters (increasing the playable roster from eight to twelve) and the option for both players to use the same characters in two-player fights, with an alternate colour scheme introduced to distinguish them from each other. Some minor gameplay revisions were also made to balance the characters out. 

Additionally, while in World Warrior one-player games could last up to ten rounds in the event of there being no clear winner (at which point the game made the player lose by default), in the ""Champion Edition"" this was reduced to just four rounds.

Playable characters:
* Ryu - a Japanese martial artist seeking to hone his skills.
* E. Honda - a sumo wrestler from Japan.
* Blanka - a beast-man from Brazil who was raised in the jungle.
* Guile - a former USAF special forces operative from the US.

Each fighter is as distinctive in feel and fighting style as they are in physical appearance, with each protagonist possessing several fantastical 'special moves' (the first genuine example of such in the fighting genre) to accompany the usual array of kicks, punches and throws. These special moves, while being difficult to execute due to the complexity of the joystick and buttons combinations required, allows the fighter to inflict huge amounts of damage on their opponent. 

Street Fighter II is a fighting game in the truest sense of the word, with deceptively deep and strategic gameplay ensuring that experienced players would destroy simple 'button mashers' with relative ease."

3509;sfeverbw;highsplt;"Space Fever High Splitter (c) 1979 Nintendo.
";"Space Fever High Splitter is another of Nintendo's takes on the ""Space Invaders"" franchise, only with a twist : if you don't quite hit the alien in the middle, you'll split the alien in two, both of which you'll have to shoot. The alien crafts are arranged in rows and they slowly move left and right across the screen. When the row reaches the edge, the ships drop down a row and move in the opposite direction (one exception : see below). As you shoot more enemies the speed will increase, as will the number of enemy bullets. You have four blocks above you that absorb the enemy shots until they are worn through, and being hit by an enemy shot will cost you a life. Sometimes a UFO will fly along the top of the screen; hit it and you'll get points and a smaller alien, hit the smaller alien and get more points.

There are three different game modes for 1- or 2-player games :
Game A : aliens go down two, up one, down two, up one.
Game B : aliens show up in one up-and-down row, they add a row each time they reach the edge and turn around.
Game C : The same as ""Space Invaders"" - all the aliens move as one 'block' in the same direction."

Additional attack moves can be utilised by moving the joystick up or down and pressing punch and kick buttons. It's also possible to combine punch and kick attacks to obtain different combos and while the enemies can do the same, the number and variation of their attacks is generally lower than those available to the players.

In addition to being able to possess nearby enemies, Shadow Force also features something else new to the side-scrolling beat-em-up genre; at the end of each stage players take part in a bonus round consisting of a one-on-one fight.

As with the prequel, players take control of a superbike and must race over twisting road-based circuits, avoiding rival bikers and trying to reach the end-of-stage checkpoint before the time limit expires.

For the sequel, Sega introduced the hilly, undulating roads that had been executed so superbly in 1986's ""Out Run"". The gameplay was further enhanced with the introduction of the 'turbo' button. Upon reaching the bike's maximum speed of 280kph, players could press and hold the turbo and push the bike up to 324kph - something that was necessary to beat the game's extremely tight time limits. This had to be used carefully, however, as the increase in speed made the bike harder to control and accelerating at the wrong time would invariably see a head-on collision with either rival bikers or the road-side objects that litter the stages.

Players could chose to race on any one of four courses: Africa, Asia, America and Europe. Africa is the easiest and shortest of the four, with each subsequent course becoming both more demanding - with tighter bends and more aggressive rival racers - and having a greater number of stages to have to beat. Africa, for example, is made up of only six stages, while the hardest course, Europe, has eighteen stages."

The player's on-screen counterpart carries a portable jetpack under his arm which allows him to fly. The player can also run along the ground to avoid overhead structures and enemies.

In addition to its flight capability, the jetpack is also equipped with a laser, used to destroy both the game's many enemies as well as some (but not all) obstructions, such as the trees and floating rocks on the first stage.

Space Harrier has a total of 18 stages, each with a boss fight at the end. Three exceptions are the bonus stages (5th and 12th) and the 18th stage, which is a 'boss rush' featuring some of the bosses encountered up to that point."

To complete a mission, the player must rescue all of the kidnapped children on each level, with the number of hostages remaining displayed on a meter in the bottom left corner of the screen.

The Shinobi Ninja begins each level armed with either 'shuriken' throwing stars or a gun for long-range attacks; and a Samurai sword for close-range combat. In addition, the Ninja also has one 'Magic Attack' per level; a smart bomb which kills or damages all on-screen enemies. A points bonus is awarded whenever a level is completed without the Magic Attack being used. An end-of-level guardian awaits the player at the end of each mission, and each takes several hits before it is killed. Once a boss is defeated, the player is taken to a bonus stage in which a large number of Ninjas will try to 'jump' from the back of the screen to the front to attack the player. A bonus life is awarded if the player manages to kill all of the Ninjas without being attacked.

Completing the fourth mission will unlock the final 'boss' mission, in which the player must battle a number of bosses which includes the rogue 'Strider Hien' from the first Strider game. Once all missions are completed, the character of Strider Hien - who wields two ranged cyphers - is unlocked.

To add variety to the tight gameplay, Capcom included special unlockable and powerful skills to aid players on their missions. These included the Savage Slash ('Midare-Giri' in Japanese), Hassou Jump, Boost (unlimited if missions defeated by Hien) and rapid slash.

Strider 2 features improved graphics - now rendered in pseudo 3-D - but with hack-and-slash gameplay largely unaltered from the first game. One difference to the original is a greater emphasis placed on boss encounters."

";"Shocking is a charming action adventure game wish some puzzle elements.  You are a werewolf seeking to return to your normal form and this quest will lead you to save the world.

Each round features a new objective to complete in order to clear the single screen level and continue on your journey.  There are 12 rounds in each stage and each stage ends with a boss battle.  Interspersed within the stages are various mini-game challenges where the player can earn extra lives.

The game is over once you have lost all of your lives."

";"More of an update than a full-blown sequel, Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad picks up where the first game - released a year earlier - left off. Once again, one or two players face the might of a terrorist army who are threatening to destroy the world by launching a newly developed weapon-of-mass-destruction if their wishes - to be given absolute control of the newly-founded nation of Billberk - aren't granted.

Like many Neo Geo sequels, 2nd Squad doesn't particularly do anything the original didn't do. There are some improvements, however; graphics have been given a brush up and level design is a little more imaginative than that of the already impressive original."

";"Shock Troopers pits the players against a mighty terrorist group who are holding a girl hostage, in order to force her grandfather to surrender a powerful drug which will enable the terrorists to control the minds of the grandfather's soldiers and create a huge, unstoppable army.

Shock Troopers is a multi-directional scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players that builds upon the foundations laid by Capcom's 1985 classic, ""Commando (Capcom)"" and also borrows heavily from Commando's sequel, '""Mercs"". As well as enemy troops, players must contend with tanks, choppers and assorted military vehicles, and must also be careful to avoid any of the landmines that litter the levels. Extra weapons and health can be picked up from destroyed enemy vehicles, as well as being found in enemy supply crates. Shock Troopers is effectively three games in one as players can chose one of three different routes; each made up of different levels. The game also offers greater variety of gameplay than other of the genre; with levels having the players travel on the back of fast moving vehicles, climbing a rock face etc."

";"Satan's Hollow is a 1- or a 2-player game. When playing this game, the Rocket Launcher is under YOUR control. YOU make it move back and forth across the screen to launch Rockets that will eliminate your attackers. These attackers are displayed in groups, called 'racks', across the top of the screen. The first rack is made up of a small number of attackers. The second rack is made up of a larger number of these attackers. And intermixed with the racks of attackers is a rack with only a single fire-breathing Devil's head. 

The attackers and the Devil's Head will try to wipe out your Rocket Launcher. If they do, you lose one player. In emergencies, you have a Shield which goes all around your Rocket Launcher for a short period of time. It is activated by pushing the Shield button on the control console. BUT BE CAREFUL!! This consumes a lot of power and will only last a VERY SHORT TIME! 

Each attacker eliminated will cause a Bridge Section to appear at the lower left corner of the screen EXCEPT : when there is already a Bridge Section there or when you have a Bridge Section in tow under your Rocket Launcher. Pick these Sections up with your Rocket Launcher and move them over to build a Bridge across the gorge at the right side of the screen leading into the land of SATAN. 

When you complete your Bridge into the land of SATAN, you can cross it and do battle with him. If you win you will be rewarded by increased fire power for your Rocket Launcher. If SATAN defeats you, you lose one player. 

As your skill level increases, the number of attackers is increased and the speed that the fire-breathing Devil's Head moves is increased also. 

Bonus Rocket Launchers are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values. Each attacker has an assigned point value. 

The object of the game is to HAVE FUN while constantly improving your skills as you play, eliminating as many attackers as possible each time to get the highest score."

";"An evil alien race called the 'Bozon' are trying to wipe out Mankind, and Lieutenant Henry and Sergent Sanders are given the responsibility of saving the Human Race. They each climb into a Mobilsuit - a jet-powered, heavily armoured combat suit - and set out on their mission. 

Side Arms is a horizontally - and occasionally vertically - scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players. Each player has two fire buttons, one for shooting ahead and one for shooting behind; crucial for a game in which enemies attack from all directions. Shooting certain enemies will reveal power-ups - displayed as 'POW' icons - and shooting the icons will either change their type, or reveal a special weapon. 

Finally, Side Arms features a unique power-up. These power-ups are hidden in the level and can be collected by shooting at their location with any weapon. By collecting a circle icon that flashed between the Greek 'Beta' and ok, both players can join together to become a single, highly powerful combat unit capable of firing in eight different directions. When a two-player unit is joined, BOTH players' controllers can control the unit's movement, which can cause the unit to not move if players decide to go in different directions to each other. The player who picks up this power-up will control the main weapon from his current list only and the other player will be able to fire the secondary eight-direction weapon. The eight-direction weapon can be fired by single presses or automatically by holding either fire button. 

In a two-player game, this form will break apart after one hit to the unit, returning to both players individual units. In a one-player game it will break apart after two hits, causing the second unit to be destroyed. 

Appearance of the super unit and the eight-directional weapon is dependant on which player gets the power-up. First-player unit is a primarily orange unit that fires red triangle projectiles one way. Second-player unit is a blue unit that fires blue boomerangs that fly out and return causing a slower rate of fire. 

The 8 available power-ups are : 
* Speed-up (POW symbol) 
* Speed-down (Reverse POW symbol, shows just before reaching Auto I or II) 
* Bit - (3 level power-up) 
* Spread Gun - (3 level power-up) 
* Mega Bazooka Launcher (2 level power-up) 
* 3-Way Shot (2 level power-up) 
* Auto I (Chain gun) 
* Auto II (3-Way Auto) 

Players are able to carry all of the game's available weapons simultaneously and can switch between each one to suit the situation. All weapons can also be powered-up by collecting a similar option."

Each wall has a moving cannon mounted that will fire odd shaped torpedoes at your ship. Scattered around the inside will be a bunch of pellets in various simple patterns. To complete each level you have to drive over, or shoot all of the pellets. If done quickly enough the game will skip a level (going from 1 to 3, etc), and award you point for the level skipped.

If you select Novice difficulty at the beginning, the Solar Fox's normal speed will be slow, and pressing the Speed Button will speed it up. If you should select Expert difficulty, its normal speed will be faster, and pressing the Speed Button will slow it down. Every fourth rack is also a bonus rack, and if you die in one, it will not cost you a life. After clearing ten racks, a player becomes a member of the ""10-Rack Club"" and the game will continue on as normal."
3713;solarq;solarq;"Solar Quest (c) 1981 Cinematronics.
";"In the center of the screen is a sun. Any space ships or ship's fire coming in contact with the sun are destroyed. The sun exerts an increasing gravitational pull as play progresses.

A player controlled space ship is randomly located on the screen. The space ship's movement is controlled by rotate right, rotate left, and thrust buttons. For quick escapes, the space ship can be thrust into hyperspace, causing the ship to disappear and then reappear in a different location.

The space ship possesses two weapons. The first weapon consists of shots fired by pressing the fire button. These shots will destroy any alien ships they strike, but will disintegrate if they do not hit any targets. The second weapon is a nuke which is launched by pressing the nuke button. The nuke will continue to travel across the screen until either it strikes a target or the player detonates the nuke by pressing the nuke button a second time. The nuke will destroy all alien ships within a limited radius of the explosion.

At the top of the screen is a display showing the player's score, the number of ships remaining, and the number of nukes a player has available.

The game consists of different phases. Each phase begins with several alien ships appearing from random points along the edge of the screen. The number of the alien ships is determined by the phase, with a maximum of eight ships for any single type of alien ship in a phase.

The alien ships move across the screen in a random pattern. After a predetermined time, dependent upon the phase, the alien ships will begin to chase the player's space ship. The player must shoot the alien ships before his ship is rammed by an alien ship. In later phases, the alien ships can shoot at the player's space ship as well as ram it.

Any alien ship that is destroyed by the player will leave a survivor. The player can either capture or kill the survivor. Survivors cannot be killed with nukes. If the survivor is neither captured nor killed, it will begin to drift towards the sun. Survivors disappear when they come in contact with the sun.

If the player does not shoot any alien ships, one or two ghost ships will appear and begin to chase the player's space ship. The ghost ship will shoot at the player's space ship during any phase. The length of time it takes for the ghost ships to appear shortens with each phase, until at least one is always present. A ghost ship will not leave a survivor when it is destroyed.

During a phase, seven different types of alien ships will appear. It is possible for several types of alien ships to be on the screen at one time. A phase is completed after all the alien ships have been destroyed or a specific amount of time has elapsed.

A player must be careful when using hyperspace. Excessive use will cause hyperspace to lock-out for a short period, making a player's space ship more vulnerable. A player's space ship cannot be destroyed in hyperspace.

As play continues, each phase becomes successively more difficult; the number of alien ships increases, the length of time before the alien ships attack shortens, and the alien ships firing capability activates. When a player's space ship is destroyed, play resumes at the same point. The game ends when all of a player's space ships are destroyed.

1- and 2-player options are available. In the 2-player mode, players alternate until all their ships are destroyed. If 1-player receives more extra ships than another, he will be allowed to play the extra ships even though his opponent's game is over.

An extra nuke is awarded every 10,000 points. An extra space ship is awarded after capturing a specified number of survivors."

";"Solomon's Key is a single player platform/puzzle game in which the wizard Dana is on a quest to retrieve Solomon's key and vanquish the demon hordes that have broken through into his world. To achieve this Dana must advance through the fifty rooms of 'Constellation Space', before finally reaching the magical key.

Dana is armed with a magic wand that can be used to both destroy and create granite blocks, while blocks situated directly above Dana's head can be destroyed by repeatedly jumping up into them until they shatter. The blocks act as platforms, as well as barriers to defend Dana from the numerous patrolling enemies. Each room contains a golden key, retrieving this automatically opens the room's exit door and players must then try to find/create a safe route past the constantly spawning demons to reach the exit and progress to the next room. 

Bonus Items - some hidden inside pre-existing granite blocks - are scattered throughout each room. Collecting these earns the player extra points. Power-ups can also be found, these appear as potion bottles with a flame emblazoned on them and a maximum of three can be carried at any one time. When a potion is used, Dana shoots a fireball which will move along the walls and platforms until it hits and kills the first demon it comes into contact with.

As well as bonus items and power-ups, each room also contains a hand-bell. When collected this triggers the release of a trapped fairy, the fairy will then slowly fly around the room and can be rescued for bonus points. An extra life is awarded for every ten fairies rescued.

The game's levels are based on Zodiac star constellations. The main levels are divided into groups of four - making a total of fourty-eight standard rooms - with each group representing a separate constellation. In addition to the standard rooms, each constellation also has a secret bonus room that can only be accessed by finding the given constellation's 'Seal', which is located in the last room of each group. There are three further secret rooms - 'Page of Time', 'The Page of Space' and the 'Princess Room' - that are only accessible if the player has found the 'Hidden Seals of Solomon'.

The four room groups are:
1-4 Aries 5-8 Taurus 9-12 Gemini
13-16 Cancer 17-20 Leo 21-24 Scorpio

";"The third game in this excellent series adheres to the solid shoot-em-up template set down by its predecessors. The player takes on the role of a Jet Fighter aircraft pilot whose mission is to combat world terrorism. The object of the game is to fly from country to country and destroy all opposition around the world, before flying into outer space to combat the menace responsible for the terrorism. Each pilot has his own storyline that ties in with the game.

One enemy shot destroys the player's plane and releases a special power-up that the plane may have been carrying. If the player's final ship is destroyed, all power-ups and extra bombs are released and can be collected if the player chooses the 'continue' option, or if a second player is still active. However, on the final mission in Outer Space, the player is forced to start again at the beginning of the space mission, unless 2 players are active.

Sonic Wings now features an array of 10 selectable pilots :
American Vought F4U Corsair piloted by Robo-Keaton. 
American Northrop P-61 Black Widow piloted by the Blazers.

";"The game is a 2-D sidescrolling platformer. The screen scrolls automatically, only stopping to fight major enemies. The screen features six continuous platforms that occasionally feature small gaps. Sonson and Tonton walk automatically across these platforms. Pressing up or down will cause them to jump up or down to the next platform. Pressing left causes them to move more slowly than the screen scrolls, essentially continuing to move forward but at a reduced pace. Pressing right does the opposite - SonSon and TonTon will move across the platforms faster than the screen scrolls. The duo have only one attack - the ability to fire energy blasts from their staves. Touching an enemy or an unfriendly projectile causes the player to lose a life. If a player has any additional lives, they will return to the screen riding on a cloud that will give them temporary invincibility. If the player presses the control stick in any direction, the cloud will disappear and the character will resume its usual walking mode. The cloud will eventually disappear on its own if the control stick is not used.

Power-ups come in the form of various fruits which produce points (with enough points giving the player an extra life). Gathering certain fruit will cause all enemies currently on a screen to turn into point-bearing fruits. Walking across certain platforms will randomly cause a bamboo shoot to sprout, yielding many extra points.

";"The mystical sword of the legends, the ""Soul Edge"", ended up in the hands of the dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon of Spain. For the next 25 years he stayed dormant on the remnants of a Spanish port town, taking the souls of those who reached him during their search of the sword. His reign of terror was soon to start, but through the joined efforts of Greek divine warrior Sophitia Alexandra and Japanese kunoichi Taki, he was stopped and killed, with one of the twin Soul Edge blades being shattered in the process. As it was about to tear itself apart, young Prussian knight Siegfried Schtauffen approached the port town and battled Cervantes, whose corpse had been momentarily reanimated through Soul Edge's will. After emerging victorious, Siegfried's attention turned unto the sword. The moment he took the hilt of the cursed blade, Soul Edge released a bright column of light into the sky. This was known as the ""Evil Seed"", bound to bring calamity and death in its wake.

Three years after those events, Soul Edge uses Siegfried as its host, and now Siegfried is Nightmare, a knight wearing azure armor and sporting a hideously deformed right arm. Europe plunges into a vortex of slaughters as he and his followers claim souls to strengthen the blade in its weakened state.

3738;spacduel;spacduel;"Space Duel (c) 1982 Atari.
";"Space Duel is a 1- or 2-player game with a color X-Y video display. This display, with its 3-color guns and higher voltage, has the same technology that was used in previous Atari black-and-white X-Y displays. However, the screen now displays dazzling color and unique visual effects in a spectacular multi-dimensional video display.

Space Duel offers players a choice of 4 different game versions. One player can control a fighter or a space station. Two players, playing at the same time, can control fighters or a space station. The game offers players 12 different targets (7 split when hit), and 18 different waves. At the beginning of each wave, objects enter from the screen edge. The player(s) then tries to shoot and destroy the objects. The wave ends when all the objects are destroyed.

The play mode begins with the first wave. In the space station game, two ships appear near the center of the screen. The ships are joined together by a 'fuse'. In the fighter game, the red ship appears above the red controls. The green ship appears above the green controls. A sound is heard any time a ship appears on the screen.

A ship may fire as many as four shots on the screen at one time. However, if a ship is damaged, it may fire only one shot on the screen. Also the ship is slower to react. In space stations, a second hit to either ship destroys that ship. Then, the fuse between ships starts to burn, and the other ship explodes.

In the fighter game, players may shoot each other without losing a life. Instead, the ship blinks and disappears. After a period of time, the ship reappears in a different location. If one player loses all of his ships before the other player, his last ship returns to the screen as a damaged ship. It is possible to earn a bonus ship while damaged.

Shields protect a ship from all saucer shots and collisions. Shields wear out with time or if hit by targets. Space stations have more than twice as much shield energy as fighters.

In the first wave, spinners enter and break into two smaller pieces when shot. Each piece splits into two smaller pieces when shot again. Each of these pieces is destroyed when shot. Other targets split apart in the same manner.

At the end of each wave, a bonus wave begins and a low humming sound is heard. BONUS LEVEL, and the number of points for that level, flash on the screen. A box appears at the screen edge and ships cannot leave that boundary. Fuzzballs, stars and saucers enter and attack the player. A fighter, when shot by the other player, either just before or during the bonus wave, will not reappear until the next wave. The bonus wave ends when all targets are destroyed, or the humming sound reaches its highest pitch.

Other targets enter as the game progresses. When the number of targets is less than the wave number, or it no splitting targets have been hit in some time, saucer enters and shoots at targets and ships. The saucer shots become more accurate as play continues. Saucers may also enter as a pair. They shoot at, but do not destroy, each other. Anything caught between them will be shot. Each time the pair goes across the screen, the distance between them increases.

A player's ship may be destroyed by a shot or collision. Game play ends when all ships are destroyed."

";"Space Firebird is a one or two player game in which players are attacked from all sides by highly maneuverable Firebirds. Players can move space ship left or right and shoot a rapid-fire laser at attacking Firebirds. A special Warp Mode allows the space ship to escape danger and fire at the flock of aliens.

FIREBIRDS
The space Firebirds are a unique set of adversaries. There are three different birds, the Emperor, Eagle and Gull, which fly together in complex looping formations, firing and attacking from all directions. The player must keep track of the laser hits because each bird has a different resistance level to hits. The fearless Emperor is destroyed by four hits, the Eagle with two hits and the soaring Gull with one hit. The Eagle also has a deadly bomb which is launched at the space ship. Extra points are scored by hitting the bomb before it explodes. The bomb when hit, scatters into deadly shrapnel. To avoid the flying shrapnel, the bomb must be hit from directly underneath.

SPACE SHIP
The space ship can be moved right or left to evade attacking Firebirds. Depressing the fire button enables the space ship to shoot its laser at approaching Firebirds. Players receive 3 (adjustable) space ships per play.

WARP MODE
Activate warp mode to escape impeding danger or to strike out at approaching birds. There is only warp mode per space ship. When activated, the space ship is launched into space with a force field around it that deflects enemy fire. In warp mode, Firebirds can be eliminated by ramming into them or by firing at close range.

If all Firebirds are destroyed, the player moves into a new battle sequence that increases in difficulty. One new space ship is awarded for a score of 5,000 (adjustable) points. Game ends when all space ships are destroyed."

Extra points are scored by hitting the bomb before it explodes. The bomb when hit, scatters into deadly shrapnel. To avoid the flying shrapnel, the bomb must be hit from directly underneath.

SPACE SHIP
The space ship can be moved right or left to evade attacking Firebirds. Depressing the fire button enables the space ship to shoot its laser at approaching Firebirds. Players receive 3 (adjustable) space ships per play.

WARP MODE
Activate warp mode to escape impeding danger or to strike out at approaching birds. There is only warp mode per space ship. When activated, the space ship is launched into space with a force field around it that deflects enemy fire. In warp mode, Firebirds can be eliminated by ramming into them or by firing at close range.

If all Firebirds are destroyed, the player moves into a new battle sequence that increases in difficulty. One new space ship is awarded for a score of 5,000 (adjustable) points. Game ends when all space ships are destroyed."
3751;spacefev;spacefevo;"Space Fever (c) 1979 Nintendo.
";"The Earth is under attack from alien invaders. Shoot them out of the sky before they land. Space Fever is Nintendo's take on the ""Space Invaders"" franchise. The game is almost identical in terms of how it plays. The alien craft are arranged in rows and they slowly move left and right across the screen. When the row reaches the edge, the ships drop down a row and move in the opposite direction. As you shoot more enemies the speed will increase, as will the number of enemy bullets. You have four blocks above you that absorb the enemy shots until they are worn through, and being hit by an enemy shot will cost you a life. Sometimes a UFO will fly along the top of the screen and can be hit for Bonus points.

There are three different game modes for 1- or 2-player games :
Game A - There are two 'blocks' of aliens that move in opposite directions to each other.
Game B - The aliens move as one 'block', but they only appear one row at a time.
Game C - The same as ""Space Invaders"" - all the aliens move as one 'block' in the same direction."

The most noticeable difference from his predecessors is that to complete a level you can now collect all the gems in the maze, in a ""Pacman""-like game or destroy all of the Rammers (like in ""Targ""). Rammers and Spectars continue to appear from flashing pods, so you cannot rest and plan your course easily, or you will be overwhelmed by the alien force.

The enemies too are smarter and faster, and the fact that they go on spawning from the pods makes the game a even more frenzy challenge."

3803;spf2xj;spf2xj;"Super Puzzle Fighter II X (c) 1996 Capcom Co, Limited.
";"Super Puzzle Fighter II X is a puzzle game for one or two players based upon Capcom's legendary ""Street Fighter"" and ""Vampire"" series of fighting games. 

Super Puzzle Fighter II X's gameplay is reminiscent of Sega's superb 1992 puzzle game, ""Puyo Puyo"" with players taking on the role of one of the famous Street Fighter characters, represented visually between the two play areas in the middle of the screen. The aim is to manipulate falling coloured gem blocks, matching the colours to gems already in the play area; before finally destroying them with orbs of a like colour. 

Gems can only be eliminated by coming into contact with a 'Crash Gem' of the same colour. This eliminates all adjacent gems of that colour, setting up the potential for huge chain reactions. 

As gems are eliminated, garbage blocks called 'Counter Gems' will drop into the opponent's playfield; these will eventually become normal gems, but only after they count down to zero (most Counter Gem countdowns start at '5' and are reduced by one each time a new pair of gems is dropped on that board), until that time they cannot be eliminated by normal means. The only way to eliminate Counter Gems before they become normal gems is to place a Crash Gem of that colour nearby so it eliminates at least one normal gem. If this is done, all Counter Gems immediately adjacent to the Crash Gem will be taken out as well. 

Additionally, gems of the same colour that form squares or rectangles (of at least two blocks tall and wide) in the pit become a giant Power Gem of that size and color; eliminating these as part of a combo increases the number of Counter Gems that would otherwise normally appear on the opponent's board. 

The only other type of piece to appear is a diamond, which eliminates all the normal, Power, Counter and Crash gems of whichever colour gem it lands on. This, too, will cause Counter Gems to appear on the opponent's board. 

Whenever a player destroys a number of blocks, their on-screen Street Fighter counter-part will be shown attacking the opponent character. The fighting move used is dependent on both the colour and number of blocks the player has destroyed. 

The available in-game characters, and games from which they are taken (based on first appearance) are : 
* Ryu (""Street Fighter"") 
* Ken (""Street Fighter"") 
* Chun-Li (""Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"") 
* Sakura (""Street Fighter Zero 2 [CP-S II No. 15]"")

3808;spiero;spiero;"Super Pierrot (c) 1987 Universal.
";"Whoo hoo, this game is nothing but dot eating fun. You play the game one screen at a time, and each screen will be covered with dots, baddies, and will have a few logs thrown in to boot. What you are trying to do is either eat all the dots, or kill all the monsters. There are two basic kinds of enemies (plus a few more that will sometimes escort the bonus letters). The first kind is a sort of green clam, these are slow moving and pose little danger to Mr. Do. But the second kind is fairly dangerous, it is a purple cartoon snake, and it will make quick rolling attacks at Mr. Do!, you must dodge these, as your powerball is ineffective against a rolling snake. Both enemy types will sometimes transform into a purple sightless unicorn if they manage to remain alive long enough, shoot the unicorns as soon as they appear, because you cannot outrun them over long distances.

Mr. Do! has two things to defend himself with. The first is the superball, he starts out carry this, simply toss it at an enemy, and they will vanish (you can also bounce the superball off of walls for a higher score). Your superball regenerates as you eat dots and fruit, and it is often a good idea to use it as soon as it regenerates (to take out yet another baddie). Your other weapon is the logs that are scattered around the game board. Simply push them, and they will roll down the screen, taking out anything in their path (including Mr. Do! if you are dumb enough to get in their way).

You leave a line behind you as you walk, when you meet your own line (creating a box), any dots inside the box will be upgraded to cherries, while cherries upgrade to apples, which upgrade to lemons, which finally upgrade to pineapples. You don't have to do any of this fruit upgrade stuff at all, but is the best way to rack up a lot of points. You can collect letters to spell EXTRA to get a free man (just like all the other ""Mr. Do!"" games)."

";"Super Punch-Out!! is an update of the superb boxing game, ""Punch-Out!!"", featuring five new larger-than-life opponents. The player once again assumes the role of a green-haired boxer who must fight his way up through five boxers to earn the title of 'Champ'. 

As with the original game, the player's boxer is viewed from behind with his torso rendered with wire-frame graphics (allowing the player's opponent to be easily seen). Punches, dodges and blocks must all be well-timed in order to defeat the opponent. 

Both the player and the opponent have stamina meters displayed at the top of the screen. These decrease when either boxer takes a punch and boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out completely. Faster knockdowns will cause the fallen boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch. 

Thanks to the refined roster of new and hugely distinctive enemy fighters, Super Punch-Out!! is considered to be an improvement over the first game."

3835;spyhunt;spyhunt;"Spy Hunter (c) 1983 Bally Midway Mfg. Co.
";"Spy Hunter is an action/driving game. It places the player as the driver of a G-6155 CIA Prototype Interceptor sports car. The object of the game is to travel the freeways and waterways, hunting down and destroying as many enemy vehicles as possible, all the while not harming civilian vehicles. The view is top-down and the screen scrolls vertically underneath the player's car.

The game begins with the player driving the G-6155. Soon, the player starts to encounter enemy vehicles which try to force the player's car off the road and crash. Each enemy vehicle has its own special feature, such as tire slashers or bulletproof armor.

Points are scored for driving on the road and for destroying enemy vehicles. There is a lead-in time when the player has an endless supply of cars. After this time expires, the player will lose a life each time the car crashes. Extra cars can be earned with high scores. The first extra car is earned at a default value of 30,000 points, but this value can vary depending on settings.

The player must be careful to avoid harming civilian vehicles on the road. There are three types: blue automobiles, pink automobiles, and motorcycles. Hurting these vehicles causes scoring to stop briefly, during which time the player's score reads 'NO POINTS'.

Initially, the only weapon the player's car has available is a dual front-mounted machine gun which has an endless supply of ammunition. Early on, these guns and the player's driving skill are his only weapons against the enemy cars. The player can also attempt to force or ram the enemy cars off the road. Eventually the player encounters an ally, the weapons van. After the player drives past the weapons van parked on the side of the road, the van accelerates past the player's car and positions itself in front of it and drops a ramp. The player can then drive up the ramp to enter the back of the van. The van then pulls to the side of the road and deploys the spy car equipped with a new weapon. A symbol atop the weapons van indicates which type of special weapon it carries. The player is not obligated to use the weapons supplied by the van. Also, if uninterested, the player can simply ignore the van and drive past it.

There are three special weapons in all and they can all be equipped simultaneously. The special weapons consist of an oil slick, a smoke screen and missiles. Each special weapon has a limited number of uses. The smoke screen and missiles can each be used three times. The special weapons are activated via dedicated buttons on the steering wheel. Once the weapons ammo is depleted or before, the car can be refitted with a new supply from the weapons van.

There are six enemies in all, each with their own special characteristic : 
* 'Switchblade' or 'Never To Be Trusted' cars have tire slashers. Knives pop out of this car's tires and can force the player's car to crash if they touch his tires.
* 'The Road Lord' or 'Bulletproof Bully' cars have bulletproof armor plating; machine guns are ineffective against these cars.
* 'The Enforcer' or 'Double Barrel Action' is a limousine with a shotgun-toting thug who shoots at the player's car.
* 'The Mad Bomber' or 'Master Of The Sky' is a helicopter which drops bombs. This enemy can only be destroyed with missiles.
* 'Barrel Dumper' is a boat which drops lethal explosives into the water.
* 'Doctor Torpedo' is a boat which shoots torpedoes at the player's ship.

Occasionally a message appears on screen that says 'Bridge Out - Detour on Left'. Then the player must drive his car into a boathouse located alongside the road, otherwise he will crash into the water and lose a life. After driving through this house, the player's car is turned into a speedboat on a river, with enemy boats which try to destroy the player. In this area, if the player uses the oil slick, the boat instead issues a line of fire which destroys any ship directly behind the player. In this area, occasionally the river splits; the left side continues the river, the right side causes the player to drive through another house where the boat is changed back into the car.

Later in the game the player gets a warning that there are 'Icy Roads Ahead', then the player enters an area that has a white road which is very slick. The icy roads section eventually ends and goes back to normal roads. Icy roads occur again on and off during the rest of the game."

* Completely new portraits for all characters. M. Bison ('Vega' in Japan) now has a winged-skull on his hat instead of a star. 

* New endings for the bosses. The last part of Chun Li's ending is also modified, letting the player choose whether she should now live a normal girl's life or continue being a detective. 

* Vega ('Balrog' in Japan) no longer climbs the fence on his stage prior to doing his 'Flying Barcelona Attack' or 'Izuna Drop' moves. He now just jumps to the edge of the screen and jumps off, as he does in the other stages. 

* Voice samples for all characters and announcer re-recorded with different actors. Each character now have their own unique voice so there is no more shared voice samples (e.g. the male 'KO' scream). 

* Background music playback is handled differently. The background music will play continuously from Round 1 to Round 2 until a character causes the KO sign to flash on Round 2, which will trigger the 'Heavy Damage' version of the music. From Round 3 onward, the music is played in the same format as in previous SFII games. 

* Four completely new stage backgrounds with new background music to accompany the New Challengers. 

* Color schemes for the twelve original stage backgrounds have changed once again :

4) Guile stage: The sky is back to daytime, the canopy on the jet is now clear, and the people in the background are now dressed in blue. The symbol on the ground is back to blue, but the missile linings are still red. 
5) Ken stage: The tugboat has been replaced with a yacht, the two guys on the top now wear orange clothes and white clothes. On the bottom, the first person now wears a green shirt and has gray hair, the second person now wears white t-shirt and yellow pants, the third person now has long hair and wears white top and pink skirt, the fourth person now wears light blue shirt and orange pants, and the guy in the trenchcoat and hat is now replaced by a new person in blue shirt and navy blue pants.
6) Chun Li stage: The sky is now sunset, the two customers now wear orange, the meat store's roof is now green with its sign back to red, the guy holding the chicken now wears blue, the ""Shanghai Friend Corridor"" sign is now red-orange with yellow letters, the guy to the right now wears green pants, and the water sign is now blue.
7) Zangief stage: The stage floor is now green, and the area to the left is back to red. In addition, the fence on the left foreground is now lowered a bit. 
8) Dhalsim stage: The curtains and stone floor are now green, and the carpet is back to red. 
9) Balrog ([JP] M. Bison) stage: While the stage floor is still purple, the 'Las Vegas' on the floor is now yellow. The car to the left is now blue, and the car to the right is now green. The guy throwing the confetti at win/lose now wears yellow, the guy next to the car to the left now wears purple and the guy next to the guy throwing the confetti has been redesigned.
10) Vega ([JP] Balrog) stage: The stage floor now shows off a green hue, and the fence now comes crashing down at the start of the fight.

";"The fourth game in the SFII series featured all new graphics, redone sounds, and above all, four characters new to the series. Here is a full list of changes from previous SFII games:

* New title screen with new music. 

* Completely new portraits for all characters. M. Bison ('Vega' in Japan) now has a winged-skull on his hat instead of a star. 

* New endings for the bosses. The last part of Chun Li's ending is also modified, letting the player choose whether she should now live a normal girl's life or continue being a detective. 

* Vega ('Balrog' in Japan) no longer climbs the fence on his stage prior to doing his 'Flying Barcelona Attack' or 'Izuna Drop' moves. He now just jumps to the edge of the screen and jumps off, as he does in the other stages. 

* Voice samples for all characters and announcer re-recorded with different actors. Each character now have their own unique voice so there is no more shared voice samples (e.g. the male 'KO' scream). 

* Background music playback is handled differently. The background music will play continuously from Round 1 to Round 2 until a character causes the KO sign to flash on Round 2, which will trigger the 'Heavy Damage' version of the music.

3916;starcas;starcas;"Star Castle (c) 1980 Cinematronics.
";"Star Castle is a 1- or 2-player outer space action game designed with features geared for maximum player appeal : A progressively difficult competitive level and a clearly defined enemy which must be both attacked and avoided at various points in the course of play.

The center of the playfield is occupied by the Star Castle which is programmed to constantly home in on the players' ships. Surrounding the Star Castle are three concentric energy rings of twelve segments each, which serve as both a protective perimeter for the Star Castle and a source of points for the player. Contained within the energy rings are three protective mines which seek out the players' ships and destroy them upon collision. The movements of the mines are programmed to simulate the actions of heat-seeking missiles.

The object of the games of Star Castle is to score the maximum number of points possible. This is accomplished by the combination of three elements :
a) Exploding the ring segments.
b) Exploding the Star Castle.
c) Avoiding the Star Castle's mines. A player's turn is over when his ship has been destroyed. The number of ships per game is set by the operator.

For maximum scoring, a player will want to shoot out sections of the energy rings in order to give him a shot at the Star Castle in the center of the screen. As play progresses, there are 2 facts a player must keep in mind :
1) Exploding all segments in a given ring will cause the entire ring to reappear - thereby eliminating a potential shot at the Star Castle in the center.
2) Exploding the rings in a manner that gives you a shot at the Star Castle will also give the Star Castle a shot at you. The Star Castle is programmed so that its nose always seeks out the player's ship. If there is an open shot at the player, it will take it.

When the Star Castle is hit by a player's missile, it will first implode and then explode with all remaining ring segments. After a one-second delay, the Star Castle will reappear with all three ring segments. If the Star Castle shoots the player, his turn is over.

As play begins, the Star Castle will appear in the center of the screen surrounded by its 3 energy rings. The player's ship appears about halfway up on the right hand edge. By using the control buttons to move forward, right or left, the player maneuvers about the screen using the firing button to launch missiles.

Points are scored by destroying the energy ring segments or the Star Castle itself. Exploding the Star Castle gives an extra ship as well as points. No points are given for the mines that attack the player.

The player's ship can be destroyed in 2 ways : By collision with the mines or by a hit from the Star Castle's torpedo. The mines are launched from the rings and attack the player for approximately ten seconds or until shot. The Star Castle's torpedoes are launched only when there is a clear shot at the player through all 3 rings. At this time the player also has his shot at the Star Castle. Both the Star Castle and the mines get smarter and faster as the game progresses.

";"Star Castle is a 1- or 2-player outer space action game designed with features geared for maximum player appeal : A progressively difficult competitive level and a clearly defined enemy which must be both attacked and avoided at various points in the course of play.

The center of the playfield is occupied by the Star Castle which is programmed to constantly home in on the players' ships. Surrounding the Star Castle are three concentric energy rings of twelve segments each, which serve as both a protective perimeter for the Star Castle and a source of points for the player. Contained within the energy rings are three protective mines which seek out the players' ships and destroy them upon collision. The movements of the mines are programmed to simulate the actions of heat-seeking missiles.

The object of the games of Star Castle is to score the maximum number of points possible. This is accomplished by the combination of three elements :
a) Exploding the ring segments.
b) Exploding the Star Castle.
c) Avoiding the Star Castle's mines. A player's turn is over when his ship has been destroyed. The number of ships per game is set by the operator.

For maximum scoring, a player will want to shoot out sections of the energy rings in order to give him a shot at the Star Castle in the center of the screen. As play progresses, there are 2 facts a player must keep in mind :
1) Exploding all segments in a given ring will cause the entire ring to reappear - thereby eliminating a potential shot at the Star Castle in the center.
2) Exploding the rings in a manner that gives you a shot at the Star Castle will also give the Star Castle a shot at you. The Star Castle is programmed so that its nose always seeks out the player's ship. If there is an open shot at the player, it will take it.

When the Star Castle is hit by a player's missile, it will first implode and then explode with all remaining ring segments. After a one-second delay, the Star Castle will reappear with all three ring segments. If the Star Castle shoots the player, his turn is over.

As play begins, the Star Castle will appear in the center of the screen surrounded by its 3 energy rings. The player's ship appears about halfway up on the right hand edge. By using the control buttons to move forward, right or left, the player maneuvers about the screen using the firing button to launch missiles.

Points are scored by destroying the energy ring segments or the Star Castle itself. Exploding the Star Castle gives an extra ship as well as points. No points are given for the mines that attack the player.

";"Exidy STARFIRE is a single player game which simulates combat between space-going fighters. The player can control the speed and direction of his fighter and attack enemy fighters with his lasers; the enemy fighters shoot fireballs at the player. The object of play is to accumulate points by destroying enemy fighters. A player can buy extra playtime during play and continue the game he is playing, as long as he has any time left; he earns bonus playtime each time he exceeds a bonus score. The game keeps track of 20 high scores - one score for each number of coins accumulated. The initials of high scoring players are displayed during the game's attract mode.

Play Mode - The screen shows a crosshair gun sight at the center of a background of stars; enemy ships move across this background. The background moves as the player works the controls, but the crosshairs always stay at the center of the screen.

The bottom of the screen has several indicators and a message panel.  A thrust indicator shows the player's speed and forward-reverse direction, and a long range scan indicator shows the presence and direction of any enemy ships off the main screen. Other indicators show the player's current score and fuel level. The message panel tells whether the player has hit an enemy ship or been hit himself, whether his laser is ready to fire, etc.

Enemy fighters move in all directions on the screen, getting larger or smaller as they move toward or away from the player. Bonus Exidy pirate ships move from left to right across the screen, and always stay the same size. The fighters and pirate ships come in three colors: blue, green, and gold (actually orange). Blue fighters are worth 10 points, green fighters 20 points, and gold fighters 40 points; all bonus Exidy pirate ships are worth 50 points.

When a target (an enemy fighter or bonus Exidy pirate ship) comes near the crosshairs, two gauge scales appear - one from the right side and one from the bottom of the screen.  At the same time, a warning beep sounds. If the player maneuvers the target into the crosshairs, it is locked-on - the enemy is frozen in the crosshairs for several seconds, and the player can easily destroy it with his laser. When the player locks onto the enemy, a second warning beep sounds, a 'LOCKED!' message appears on the message panel, and the target flashes in the crosshairs.

Press the laser fire button, and four simulated laser beams converge on the center crosshairs from the corners of the screen. If the lasers hit a target, it explodes. Enemy fighters can shoot fireballs at the player; if a fireball hits, the screen flashes and the player is penalized by being reset to blue targets.

STARFIRE produces a wide variety of sound effects. An ENGINE RUMBLE sounds throughout the play, and an EXPLOSION sounds whenever an enemy explodes or the player is hit by enemy fire. There is a LASER sound whenever the player pushes the laser fire button, and a HISS whenever an enemy fighter fires at the player.

There are four different kinds of WARNING BEEP. These warn the player when he is almost locked onto a target, when he is actually locked on, when a target is just off the edge of the screen, and when the laser overheats.

These sounds are heard only during the play mode. There is only one operator adjustment for the sound effects - the volume control.

STARFIRE has 3 player controls: a steering yoke, a thrust control, and a laser fire button. To steer right or left across the screen, turn the steering yoke like an automobile steering wheel; to move down or up, move the yoke in or out. Slide the thrust control T-handle up or down to move forward or back. The laser fire button is on the left handgrip of the steering yoke.

Awards and Bonuses - The operator can set the bonus score to 300, 500, or 700 points, or can turn off the bonus feature.  If the bonus has been set, a player has one chance of a bonus for each 300 fuel units he buys. If he tops the bonus score during any 300 unit period, the game awards him a bonus of 150 fuel units. This bonus fuel is added after the fuel indicator reaches zero. The player can only get one bonus for each 300 fuel units he buys.

The coin accumulator keeps track of the coins a player has spent. STARFIRE maintains twenty high scores : one for players who have only inserted one coin, a second for two-coin players, and so on. Players who spend more than twenty coins are lumped together in the twenty-coin score.

When a player finishes playing, STARFIRE counts the coins he has spent and compares his point score to the appropriate high score. If he has topped that score, the game asks him for his initials (one, two, or three letters); as long as his high score stands, his initials will be on the attract mode score table. If switch 7 of the DIP switch is ON, the score table will stay on screen as long as the laser fire button is pressed.

Every third coin a player spends buys double playtime. That is, STARFIRE awards four coins worth of playtime for each three coins spent."

";"STAR TREK is a 1- or 2-player SEGA Color X-Y video game with computerized speech synthesis. The player finds himself the Captain of the Starship Enterprise, his mission being to rid the universe of a number of threats to the United Federation of Planets.

STAR TREK has a unique method of displaying the information vital to the game play. This method involves the separation of the CRT into three completely separate screens.

The Scanner is where the player sees a top down or plan view of local space, with the Enterprise always in the center of this screen. The Viewer is where the player sees actual apparent 3-D images, as if he were looking out the ships front window. The Status screen displays player score in addition to Shield strength, number of Photon Torpedoes, and amount of Warp energy remaining.

The game begins by introducing Klingons, Starbases and the Enterprise into the Scanner with an exciting shrink down animation sequence. The Enterprise starts with 1 to 4 Shields and Photon Torpedoes (switch selectable). By actuating the rotary knob and depressing the Thrust button the player may maneuver about the Scanner screen.

In order to destroy enemies the player may use either of two weapons : Phasers (the Fire button) or Photon Torpedoes. Each has unique properties.
* Phasers are instantaneous, can destroy only one enemy at a time, and are in unlimited energy supply.
* Photon Torpedoes require time to travel, can destroy many enemies, and are in LIMITED supply. Displayed in the Status screen, Photon Torpedo supply appears as a red bar (squares).

For high speed, the player may depress the WARP button. While this button is held down the Enterprise moves very quickly and cannot be damaged in any way by anything. A blue bar in the Status screen displays the amount of Warp energy available, and shrinks as the Warp button is held down.

The Enterprise is shrouded by an automatic Shield, which protects the Enterprise from enemy fire and collisions. The Shields are displayed in the Status screen as green line segments (a bar). Once the strength of the Shields is depleted, the ship can sustain damage. When damaged, the Enterprise looses ship functions in the following order : Shields, Photon Torpedoes, Warp Drive. If all of these are damaged, the next hit will destroy the Enterprise and end the game.

In order to repair this damage the player may choose to dock with a Starbase. Docking is accomplished by merely flying into a Starbase. The DOCKED message appears, all damage is repaired, and a Shield unit, Photon Torpedo, and some Warp time are added to the ship’s supplies. Although only four of each supply unit is displayed at any one time, 255 can be collected.

The primary enemy is the Klingon Battle Cruiser, which comes in three colors :
* Red Klingon - ignores the Enterprise and sets out to destroy a Starbase, after which the Klingon turns purple.
* Purple Klingon - ignores Starbases and attempts to destroy the Enterprise by firing plasma energy balls. Purple Klingons will stop a certain distance away while attacking so as not to risk collision. After a certain period of time (depending on round), purple Klingons turn white.
* White Klingons - sometimes known as Maniac Klingons, these Klingons will move VERY QUICKLY and attempt to ram the Enterprise.

Anti-Matter Saucers appear randomly and move about the screen in a confusing fashion. These saucers can be destroyed only with Phasers. If the saucer collides with the Enterprise, it will attach itself, drain your ships Warp energy, then leave quickly.

After a number of rounds, the player advances to the Nomad round. In this sequence Nomad zips about the screen depositing dangerous mines. The mines cause chain reactions which should be avoided. Nomad can only be destroyed with Phasers. Once Nomad has delivered its total load of 30 mines, it waits for the last mine to detonate, leaves the screen, and ends the round.

Every 10,000 to 40,000 points (operator selectable) the player is awarded a bonus Shield unit, Photon Torpedo and Warp time unit. The two player game is played with players alternating with each complete round. Whenever a player is eliminated, the other player continues and finishes the game."

";"Star Wars is a single-player 3-D shoot-em-up based on the legendary movie franchise of the same name. This game is specifically based on the very first Star Wars movie, 'Episode IV: A New Hope'. The player takes on the role of Luke Skywalker (Red Five) whose goal is to blow up the infamous ""Death Star"" by firing a Proton Torpedo into an exposed exhaust port situated on the Death Star's surface. 

Before reaching the exhaust port, players must survive three attack phases. 

PHASE 1 : The game begins in outer space above the Death Star. Players must engage in a dog fight with Darth Vader and numerous enemy TIE Fighters. All but Vader's fighter can be shot and destroyed. Incoming enemy fire must be avoided or shot to prevent damage to the player's Deflector shields. 

PHASE 2 : The X-Wing flies down to the surface of the Death Star and is confronted with a barrage of laser turrets and towers as the X-Wing flies across the Death Star's surface. Any collisions with either the towers or incoming enemy shots will cause damage to the player's Deflector Shields. 

The laser tower tops have a progressive scoring incentive that is displayed at the top center of the screen, along with the number of remaining laser tower tops that need to be destroyed before the X-Wing enters the exhaust port trench. If the player manages to destroy all of the towers, a sizeable point bonus is awarded. 

PHASE 3 : The X-Wing begins its approach down the trench of the Death Star, heading for the exhaust port situated at the end of the trench. The trench walls are lined with red laser-gun turrets that fire at the player as he makes his approach. Incoming fire must either be avoided or shot. Trench catwalks of varying shapes and heights also appear in later trench runs. These must be avoided as any collision results in damage to Red 5's deflector shields. 

If the player survives the trench run, the voice of 'Han Solo' will advise that 'You're all clear, Kid' and the player must quickly shoot the exhaust port to destroy the Death Star. If a trench run is completed without the player having fired any shots other than the shot into the exhaust port, a sizeable point bonus is awarded for 'using the force'. If the exhaust port is missed, Red 5 will plough through the wall at the end of the trench and lose one deflector shield, after which the trench run will start over. 

If the player succeeds in blowing up the Death Star, Red 5 makes its escape before turning to view the colourful explosion. Bonus points for Remaining Shield Energy is now scored. 

The player is then returned to the fray and whole process begins again. Each successive Death Star run greatly increases in difficulty; TIE Fighters shoot more often, there are more Laser towers and batteries in successive rounds and there are many more obstacles and laser fire during the trench run."

PHASE 1 : The game begins in outer space above the Death Star. Players must engage in a dog fight with Darth Vader and numerous enemy TIE Fighters. All but Vader's fighter can be shot and destroyed. Incoming enemy fire must be avoided or shot to prevent damage to the player's Deflector shields. 

PHASE 2 : The X-Wing flies down to the surface of the Death Star and is confronted with a barrage of laser turrets and towers as the X-Wing flies across the Death Star's surface. Any collisions with either the towers or incoming enemy shots will cause damage to the player's Deflector Shields. 

The laser tower tops have a progressive scoring incentive that is displayed at the top center of the screen, along with the number of remaining laser tower tops that need to be destroyed before the X-Wing enters the exhaust port trench. If the player manages to destroy all of the towers, a sizeable point bonus is awarded. 

PHASE 3 : The X-Wing begins its approach down the trench of the Death Star, heading for the exhaust port situated at the end of the trench. The trench walls are lined with red laser-gun turrets that fire at the player as he makes his approach. Incoming fire must either be avoided or shot. Trench catwalks of varying shapes and heights also appear in later trench runs. These must be avoided as any collision results in damage to Red 5's deflector shields. 

If the player survives the trench run, the voice of 'Han Solo' will advise that 'You're all clear, Kid' and the player must quickly shoot the exhaust port to destroy the Death Star. If a trench run is completed without the player having fired any shots other than the shot into the exhaust port, a sizeable point bonus is awarded for 'using the force'. If the exhaust port is missed, Red 5 will plough through the wall at the end of the trench and lose one deflector shield, after which the trench run will start over. 

If the player succeeds in blowing up the Death Star, Red 5 makes its escape before turning to view the colourful explosion. Bonus points for Remaining Shield Energy is now scored. 

The player is then returned to the fray and whole process begins again. Each successive Death Star run greatly increases in difficulty; TIE Fighters shoot more often, there are more Laser towers and batteries in successive rounds and there are many more obstacles and laser fire during the trench run."

A lone mechanoid dragon, unhappy with the actions of his comrades, rebels and sets out to thwart their invasion of the Planet of the Golden Dragon.

Saint Dragon is a demanding and playable sideways scrolling shoot-em-up, played over six different stages. The tail of the mechanoid dragon the player controls is impervious to enemy attacks and causes damage to any enemy it touches. The head of the dragon is effectively the 'ship' of the game and a direct hit from an enemy will result in the loss of a life.

Strider Hiryu is a multi-directional scrolling platform beat-em-up in which the player takes control of 'Strider Hiryu', a ninja-style warrior who must defeat a legendary being known as 'Grandmaster Meio'. 

Set in a dystopian future in the year 2048, Meio has been watching Earth from his own distant galaxy and has created a space station (known as 'The Third Moon') between Earth and its moon in order to rule over the Human race. 

Armed with a curved sword known as a 'Falchion', Strider must travel the globe to find and destroy Meio. Numerous power-ups can be obtained from metallic item boxes carried by certain enemies. These include an extension to Hiryu's attack range that lasts for one hundred slashes, two types of health aids (represented by the kanji used to write Hiryu's name), a max health extension, an extra life and a power-up that not only makes Hiryu invulnerable to attack, but also increases his own attack abilities via shadow images of himself for 30 seconds. 

Hiryu can also summon robotic companions known collectively as ""options"" that help him fight enemies. These consist of up to two mushroom-like droids, a saber-toothed tiger and a hawk. These are referred to as Options A, B and C respectively. 

Strider Hiryu is highly agile and has the ability to latch onto walls and ceilings using a metallic hook; a concept which set the game apart from other platformers and allowed for highly inventive level design. 

The game consists of five stages: 
* Kazakh Soviet Sot Republic (called ""St. Petersburgh"" during the arcade game's attract sequence), 
* Siberian Wilderness 
* Aerial Battleship Ballog 
* Amazonian Jungle 
* The Third Moon. 

Each stage is divided into a number of smaller sections, with each section imposing its own time limit. Strider initially has a three-point health gauge (which can be increased to five points with health extension power-ups) and will lose a life when the health gauge is fully depleted. Lives are also lost by either falling into a bottomless pit, or failing to complete a section within the time limit. 

The game ends once all lives are lost, but continues are available."

Players fly a spaceship over the surface of the of planets, destroying enemy waves and rescuing humans from the alien invaders, with rescued humans hanging from the underside of the player's ship. Once these tasks have been completed, the mothership arrives to pick up the player's ship, together with any humans they have rescued. Players can decide which planets to attack, when to purchase additional firepower and when to attack the Apocalypse.

Strike Force adds several new features to the series. Two players can now share the screen at one time and the surface of each planet is littered with various special weapons that can be picked up and deployed. Humans can be 'mutated' into small green creatures that will fight against the player (although players can still pick them up for points as, with the unmutated humans). The mutants can also use vehicles found on the planet's surface against the player."

";"Take a seat, grasp the controls, and enter the world of the S.T.U.N. (Spread Tunnel Underground Network) Runner. Players travel ahead in time to the 21st century and experience the thrill of racing in a futuristic form of competitive driving. At the control of state-of-the-art technology, players pilot a billion-dollar vehicle capable of attaining speeds of over 900 miles per hour!

Players control their vehicles with a return-to-center (RTC) flight controller. Control handles adjust shot elevation and include trigger buttons for firing. The start button is also used as a fire button for 'shock waves'.

S.T.U.N. runner is a game of speed. The goal of this game is to travel as fast as possible and complete each race within the allotted time. Numerous enemies prevent the player from achieving this goal. Equipped with powerful lasers, all enemies can be gunned down with the exception of one.

The race through the S.T.U.N. Network is made up of many levels. Each level presents a unique challenge to the player. The player's ultimate goal is to guide the vehicle through the network of levels to reach the 'Ultimate Challenge'. In this never-ending race, players go as far as their driving skills will take them. If the distance they travel qualifies as one of the top five, their name (18 letters) will be displayed along the road for future players to see (only if they reach this distance).

In S.T.U.N. Runner, there is no foot pedal to control speed. Faster speed is achieved by :
* Correctly driving on the fastest portion of the tunnel.
* Staying off side rails (of flat sections).
* Avoiding collisions with enemy vehicles.
* Running over 'boosts' for hyperspeed.
* Avoiding areas under construction.

In turn, the fastest portion of the tunnel is the outer wall. Like a luge or bobsled racer, players use basic laws of physics to attain the fastest speed.  Riding on the inner wall results in a slower speed and hinders a player's ability to reach a finish line. On flat sections, running into side rails creates a visual and audio chattering resulting in a loss of speed. The first race, a training race, called 'Cake Walk', is intended to teach players how to drive correctly.

Red flashing markers in tunnels and flats are called 'boosts'. By running over these, the S.T.U.N. Runner gets a boost of hyperspeed. In addition to reaching the finish line faster, a S.T.U.N. Runner in boost in invincible. The vehicle can pass through all enemy vehicles unharmed and cannot be shot. In this mode the player's vehicle will appear transparent as though it is a skeleton.

The underground network has three different tunnel sections. They include wide tunnels, narrow tunnels, and tunnels under construction. Under construction sections contain portions that are unsurfaced. These areas do not provide full power to the vehicle, and slow down the S.T.U.N. Runner.

Open areas are called 'flats' and are both narrow and wide. Being above the ground, the player is treated to many views of the earth's surface in the 21st century. On flats, players must avoid driving along the side rails. The friction caused will slow down the S.T.U.N. Runner vehicle.

A S.T.U.N. Runner vehicle has six shields for added protection. Colliding with an enemy results in the loss of one shield. At the end of each race, players are awarded bonus points for each shield remaining. A large bonus is awarded if all shields are intact.

In the tunnels and flats are ramps. These ramps will catapult S.T.U.N. Runners above the track for a brief distance. Ramp jumping is often a good method of crossing areas under construction and avoiding collisions with enemies.

When players do not reach the finish line of a race within the allotted time, the game would normally end. However, they can be allowed to advance to the next level on a continuation.

Special Weapon : In selected races, a 'shock wave' is located along the way.  If the player can pick up the shock wave, the weapon becomes available for use. Also, shock waves can be awarded on some levels if the player hits a predetermined number of stars and completes the level. This information is green in the map at the start of each level.

Players activate the shock wave by pressing the start button. This super weapon will destroy all enemies and hazards within view. It is a one-time weapon, but more than one can be stored. The number of shock waves stored is show as blue and white icons on the screen below the level number display.

Bonus Stars : Additional points can be scored along the way by running over 'stars'. In the first race, the training race called 'Cake Walk', the stars are red. Players should run over as many stars as possible. In the remainder of the game, all bonus stars are green.

Challenge Races : These are bonus races awarded to players for reaching various points in the game. Races 5, 10, and 15 are challenge races. Each presents a unique challenge to the player.
* Boost Challenge
* Star Challenge
* Kill Challenge

In each challenge race, players have one goal. Instructions are displayed prior to the start of each race. The time clock still operates, but a game will not end because the time expires. This is considered a free bonus for players. Each challenge level has its own high score table.

Ultimate Challenge : For those players skilful and patient enough, an 'Ultimate Challenge' awaits them at the end. It is an endless race filled with enemies and unexpected surprises. The object is to travel as far as possible within the allotted time. Markers on the road display the names of the five best S.T.U.N. Runners. It is a unique method of identifying the best players of the game. These names are also presented on a separate high score table."

The first race, a training race, called 'Cake Walk', is intended to teach players how to drive correctly.

Red flashing markers in tunnels and flats are called 'boosts'. By running over these, the S.T.U.N. Runner gets a boost of hyperspeed. In addition to reaching the finish line faster, a S.T.U.N. Runner in boost in invincible. The vehicle can pass through all enemy vehicles unharmed and cannot be shot. In this mode the player's vehicle will appear transparent as though it is a skeleton.

The underground network has three different tunnel sections. They include wide tunnels, narrow tunnels, and tunnels under construction. Under construction sections contain portions that are unsurfaced. These areas do not provide full power to the vehicle, and slow down the S.T.U.N. Runner.

Open areas are called 'flats' and are both narrow and wide. Being above the ground, the player is treated to many views of the earth's surface in the 21st century. On flats, players must avoid driving along the side rails. The friction caused will slow down the S.T.U.N. Runner vehicle.

A S.T.U.N. Runner vehicle has six shields for added protection. Colliding with an enemy results in the loss of one shield. At the end of each race, players are awarded bonus points for each shield remaining. A large bonus is awarded if all shields are intact.

In the tunnels and flats are ramps. These ramps will catapult S.T.U.N. Runners above the track for a brief distance. Ramp jumping is often a good method of crossing areas under construction and avoiding collisions with enemies.

When players do not reach the finish line of a race within the allotted time, the game would normally end. However, they can be allowed to advance to the next level on a continuation.

Special Weapon : In selected races, a 'shock wave' is located along the way.  If the player can pick up the shock wave, the weapon becomes available for use. Also, shock waves can be awarded on some levels if the player hits a predetermined number of stars and completes the level. This information is green in the map at the start of each level.

Players activate the shock wave by pressing the start button. This super weapon will destroy all enemies and hazards within view. It is a one-time weapon, but more than one can be stored. The number of shock waves stored is show as blue and white icons on the screen below the level number display.

Bonus Stars : Additional points can be scored along the way by running over 'stars'. In the first race, the training race called 'Cake Walk', the stars are red. Players should run over as many stars as possible. In the remainder of the game, all bonus stars are green.

Challenge Races : These are bonus races awarded to players for reaching various points in the game. Races 5, 10, and 15 are challenge races. Each presents a unique challenge to the player.

In each challenge race, players have one goal. Instructions are displayed prior to the start of each race. The time clock still operates, but a game will not end because the time expires. This is considered a free bonus for players. Each challenge level has its own high score table.

Ultimate Challenge : For those players skilful and patient enough, an 'Ultimate Challenge' awaits them at the end. It is an endless race filled with enemies and unexpected surprises. The object is to travel as far as possible within the allotted time. Markers on the road display the names of the five best S.T.U.N. Runners. It is a unique method of identifying the best players of the game. These names are also presented on a separate high score table."

";"Take a seat, grasp the controls, and enter the world of the S.T.U.N. (Spread Tunnel Underground Network) Runner. Players travel ahead in time to the 21st century and experience the thrill of racing in a futuristic form of competitive driving. At the control of state-of-the-art technology, players pilot a billion-dollar vehicle capable of attaining speeds of over 900 miles per hour!

Players control their vehicles with a return-to-center (RTC) flight controller. Control handles adjust shot elevation and include trigger buttons for firing. The start button is also used as a fire button for 'shock waves'.

S.T.U.N. runner is a game of speed. The goal of this game is to travel as fast as possible and complete each race within the allotted time. Numerous enemies prevent the player from achieving this goal. Equipped with powerful lasers, all enemies can be gunned down with the exception of one.

The race through the S.T.U.N. Network is made up of many levels. Each level presents a unique challenge to the player. The player's ultimate goal is to guide the vehicle through the network of levels to reach the 'Ultimate Challenge'. In this never-ending race, players go as far as their driving skills will take them. If the distance they travel qualifies as one of the top five, their name (18 letters) will be displayed along the road for future players to see (only if they reach this distance).

In S.T.U.N. Runner, there is no foot pedal to control speed. Faster speed is achieved by :
* Correctly driving on the fastest portion of the tunnel.
* Staying off side rails (of flat sections).
* Avoiding collisions with enemy vehicles.
* Running over 'boosts' for hyperspeed.
* Avoiding areas under construction.

In turn, the fastest portion of the tunnel is the outer wall. Like a luge or bobsled racer, players use basic laws of physics to attain the fastest speed.

The first race, a training race, called 'Cake Walk', is intended to teach players how to drive correctly.

Red flashing markers in tunnels and flats are called 'boosts'. By running over these, the S.T.U.N. Runner gets a boost of hyperspeed. In addition to reaching the finish line faster, a S.T.U.N. Runner in boost in invincible. The vehicle can pass through all enemy vehicles unharmed and cannot be shot. In this mode the player's vehicle will appear transparent as though it is a skeleton.

The underground network has three different tunnel sections. They include wide tunnels, narrow tunnels, and tunnels under construction. Under construction sections contain portions that are unsurfaced. These areas do not provide full power to the vehicle, and slow down the S.T.U.N. Runner.

Open areas are called 'flats' and are both narrow and wide. Being above the ground, the player is treated to many views of the earth's surface in the 21st century. On flats, players must avoid driving along the side rails. The friction caused will slow down the S.T.U.N. Runner vehicle.

A S.T.U.N. Runner vehicle has six shields for added protection. Colliding with an enemy results in the loss of one shield. At the end of each race, players are awarded bonus points for each shield remaining. A large bonus is awarded if all shields are intact.

In the tunnels and flats are ramps. These ramps will catapult S.T.U.N. Runners above the track for a brief distance. Ramp jumping is often a good method of crossing areas under construction and avoiding collisions with enemies.

When players do not reach the finish line of a race within the allotted time, the game would normally end. However, they can be allowed to advance to the next level on a continuation.

Special Weapon : In selected races, a 'shock wave' is located along the way.  If the player can pick up the shock wave, the weapon becomes available for use. Also, shock waves can be awarded on some levels if the player hits a predetermined number of stars and completes the level. This information is green in the map at the start of each level.

Players activate the shock wave by pressing the start button. This super weapon will destroy all enemies and hazards within view. It is a one-time weapon, but more than one can be stored. The number of shock waves stored is show as blue and white icons on the screen below the level number display.

Bonus Stars : Additional points can be scored along the way by running over 'stars'. In the first race, the training race called 'Cake Walk', the stars are red. Players should run over as many stars as possible. In the remainder of the game, all bonus stars are green.

Challenge Races : These are bonus races awarded to players for reaching various points in the game. Races 5, 10, and 15 are challenge races. Each presents a unique challenge to the player.

In each challenge race, players have one goal. Instructions are displayed prior to the start of each race. The time clock still operates, but a game will not end because the time expires. This is considered a free bonus for players. Each challenge level has its own high score table.

Ultimate Challenge : For those players skilful and patient enough, an 'Ultimate Challenge' awaits them at the end. It is an endless race filled with enemies and unexpected surprises. The object is to travel as far as possible within the allotted time. Markers on the road display the names of the five best S.T.U.N. Runners.

Many strangely-shaped crafts, missiles and UFOs suddenly zoom in to attack you; once they are in your sights they can attack you, so shoot first and survive!

The 3-dimensional effect of fast-moving crafts and missiles, combined with the terrifying  explosions seemingly right up close to you are truly bewildering.

To destroy the BARRIER guarding the enemy COMMAND SHIP, you must hit it in the very center.

After blowing up the COMMAND SHIP, you proceed to another round.

The bonus points remaining will be added to your score.

When you reach HIGH SCORE you will get another ship.

In each successive round the score increases by 100 points over the previous round.

Your score and the round are displayed at the top of the screen. Your score and the previous best three scores are displayed over the periscope.

4015;superpac;superpac;"Super Pac-Man (c) 1982 Namco.
";"Super Pac-Man is a 1- or 2-player game where you are in control of the legendary Pac-Man. As in the original ""Pac-Man"" game, the goal is to clear each maze, but this time, instead of dots, the maze consists of prizes which are locked away behind gates. There are two ways to access the prizes. You can eat the keys which open a particular gate, and not always the gate which is closest to that key. Or you can crash through the gate after you eat a Super Pill and become Super Pac-Man. You are not required to eat all of the keys in order to complete the stage. 

Four Power Pills are in maze and allow Pac-Man to turn the tables on the ghosts and eat them for a short time. When the ghosts begin to flash, time is running out and they will switch back, so beware. 

New in this game is the Super Pill. There are two Super Pills in the maze which allow Pac-Man to become Super Pac-Man for a limited period of time. While in Super form, Pac-Man can crash through the maze gates, fly over the ghosts and avoid being killed (or eat them when they're blue), and travel at super speed whenever the player presses and holds the Super Speed button. When the super power is about to run out, Pac-Man flashes white and then returns to his normal form. You can extend the duration of Super time by eating a regular Power Pill. The Super time will then be extended by the duration of the ghosts' blue time. 

Pac-Man loses one life whenever a ghost catches him when the ghost is not blue and Pac-Man is not in Super form. You start with a set number of lives ('Lives' dip switch), and bonus lives can be awarded to you as you reach or pass certain preselected point values ('Extra Lives' dip switch). 

The tunnel is a great way to put some space between you and any ghosts that are on your tail since they can only move half as fast as you when they are in it. In Super Pac-Man, the ghosts are also slowed down by travelling through the passage directly beneath the ghost pen.

Occasionally, a star will appear in the middle of the screen with a picture on the left, and a rotating picture on the right. You may eat the star at any time for bonus points, but if you manage to eat the star when the right picture matches the left one, you will receive a larger bonus. 

As the stages increases, the ghosts speed up their pursuit of Pac-Man and they stay blue for shorter and shorter periods of time after he eats a Power Pill until, in the high stages, they do not turn blue at all. 

Super Pac-Man also features bonus stages in Stage 3, Stage 7, and every fourth stage thereafter, where there are no ghosts, a time limit, and Pac-Man is in Super form throughout the stage. Your goal is to eat all of the prizes in the given time limit. As with gameplay on the regular levels, you don't need to eat all (or any) of the keys. You are awarded the remaining time in the counter as points for successfully eating everything. With each Bonus stage, the walls and gates change color. 

Super Pac-Man remains true to the intermission formula established in ""Pac-Man"". These intermissions are more like the simple humorous anecdotes found in the original game, than the episodic stories told by the intermissions in ""Ms. Pac-Man"" and ""Jr. Pac-Man"". Super Pac-Man features four intermissions : 

1) Pac-Man enters from the left side of the screen, followed closely by the ghosts. When Pac-Man exits the screen to the right, the ghosts stop. Super Pac-Man appears high up from the right and the ghosts helplessly watch as Super Pac-Man flies over their heads and exits to the left. This intermission is played after Stage 2. 

2) As a tribute to the first intermission from the original game, Pac-Man enters from the right, and is followed by what appears to be a super version of Blinky. After they exit to the left, a super Blinky reappears from the left in his blue form, and is now followed by an even larger version of Super Pac-Man. This intermission is played after Stage 6. 

3) Pac-Man enters from the left side of the screen, followed closely by the ghosts. Before Pac-Man makes it all the way to the right, he simply disappears, leaving the ghosts stunned and puzzled. As the ghosts look around for Pac-Man's whereabouts, Clyde looks up and notices the extremely large version of Super Pac-Man falling from the sky, instantly scaring all of the ghosts blue before this super-duper Pac-Man squashes them. This intermission is played after Stage 11, which is the third Bonus Stage. 

4) The extra-large Super Pac-Man enters from the left side of the screen, followed by a pack of 32 ghosts, 8 of each color. After exiting to the right, four scared (blue) super ghosts reappear from the right. Much to their misfortune, they are being chased by 32 normal-sized Pac-Men. This intermission is played after Stage 16 and every 4th stage thereafter. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

* Pac-Man - Once again, you control the little yellow hero as you guide him through the maze and onto victory. Pac-Man's goal is to gobble up every target item. He must avoid contact with the ghosts unless they are blue as a result of Pac-Man eating a Power Pill, or when Pac-Man is in Super form as a result of eating a Super Pill. Unlike the other classic Pac-games, Pac-Man does not move any slower when he's eating targets than when he isn't. True to the other Pac-games, however, he is still capable of turning around corners faster than the ghosts, so make as many turns as possible when the ghosts are on his tail.

* Super Pac-Man - After eating a Super Pill, Pac-Man becomes large and in charge. In Super form, he can eat through gates without the use of a key, fly over ghosts without colliding with them (the ghosts actually change in appearance, becoming squat or thin depending on the direction they are moving; this ability does not prevent Super Pac-Man from eating blue ghosts), moving faster when the Super Speed button is held down, and extending the duration of his super power by eating a normal Power Pill. When Pac-Man's Super power is about to expire, he flashes white just like the ghosts do when they are about to change back to normal. 

* Ghosts - Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde are back. Basically, they behave the same. Blinky follows you more closely than any of the other ghosts, shadowing your trail, Pinky tries to stay one step ahead of you by second-guessing which way you will go and trapping you, Inky usually turns away if you take him head on, and Clyde does his own thing for the most part. In this game, their behavior is a tad more random than in the first game, so patterns cannot be relied upon. Also new in Super Pac-Man, they will exhibit a ""stutter"" behavior from time to time where they seem to shake in one spot briefly before continuing on. This can sometimes save you if you are being chased, or it can mess you up if you are following behind a ghost too closely. 

* Scared Ghosts - As in the original game, if Pac-Man eats a Power Pill, the ghosts will turn blue for a short period of time. The higher the stage, the shorter that time becomes, until the ghosts don't turn blue at all (but they do change direction). Eating ghosts scores big points (see Scoring below), but watch out when they start flashing because they're about to change back to their normal state. 

* Power Pills - A carry-over from the original ""Pac-Man"" game. These four large white blinking dots in the corners of the maze allow Pac-Man to temporarily chase and eat the ghosts until they begin to flash and turn back to normal. In this game, eating a Power Pill while in Super form extends Super time into the ghosts' blue time. 

* Super Pills - These two green pills grow and shrink in size close to the middle of the maze. When Pac-Man eats one of these, he grows to Super size and gains the power to crash through barriers, fly over ghosts, and use Super Speed. 

* Keys - The ultimate prize in the original game becomes an integral tool in this game. Eat the keys to open the gates that block your access to the prizes. You don't have to eat all of the keys to complete the stage. The maze contains 15 keys in all. 

* Gates - The doors that block Pac-Man from eating the prizes he needs to eat in order to complete the stage. There are 37 gates in all. 

* Prizes - Unlike in the original game, where you had to eat dots and collect the prizes for bonus points, you must eat all of prizes to complete the stage. The maze contains 31 prizes in all. 

* Bonus Star - Once Pac-Man has eaten a total of 15 items in the maze (including power pills and super pills, but not including keys), a bonus star will appear with one picture to the left, and a rapidly changing picture to the right. Eat the star for bonus points, or try to eat the star when the pictures match for an even higher bonus. Try to eat the star when the pictures on either side match and are the same as the current stage's main prize (for example, apples in Stage 1) to score the maximum possible bonus points.

* Tunnel - By going through one end of the tunnel, Pac-Man and the ghosts can cross over to the other side of the screen. Any ghost who goes through the tunnel will move at half speed. This speed decrease also occurs under the ghost pen now."

4046;swat;swat;"SWAT (c) 1984 Sega.
";"An abstract one or two player shoot-em-up in which the aim is to stop swarms of aliens from building a sectional tunnel from the bottom of the screen to the top.

At the top of each level are blue tunnel sections, while at the bottom are purple ones. Aliens start at the bottom of the screen in the purple sections. As they move through a tunnel, they can build new sections in any direction.

Players can either destroy blue tunnel sections, or 'shove' them to re-align them and prevent the aliens from completing their mission. Purple sections cannot be destroyed but they CAN be shoved. A 'smart bomb' can be deployed which will destroy all nearby enemies, as well as the players, on-screen counter-parts should they be within the blast radius when the bomb explodes. Additional bombs can be earned by destroying blue sections of tunnel.

If the aliens succeed in connecting up a tunnel, additional enemies appear and the challenge increasing substantially. Each round ends when a preset number of 'Blocker' aliens have been destroyed.

There are four types of enemies :

* BLOCKERS - These foes build the tunnels and they can exit the tunnel system or be forced out. If they exit the tunnels, they produce 'Expelers' (see below) and quickly make their way to the bottom of the screen to re-enter the tunnels. This is the only time that they are vulnerable.

* EXPELERS - These enemies, produced by the Blockers, chase the players around the screen and attempt to corner them. They travel at different speeds, generally moving faster as they get closer to SWAT agents.

* ANNGRERS - These cubed-shaped foes are invulnerable to the SWAT agent's fire. Shooting this type of enemy will cause it to chase the players very quickly. They can be destroyed by using bombs, but a new Anngrer will be created in its place at the bottom of the screen. These enemies can travel in and out of the tunnel system wherever they choose.

* SWEEPERS - Along with additional enemy fire, these foes appear in pairs on the left and right sides of the tunnel along if the bottom and top portions of the screen are connected by one continuous tunnel. They will line up with each other on either side of the players' SWAT agents and fire at them. Sweepers require multiple shots to be destroyed."

4061;szaxxon;szaxxon;"Super Zaxxon (c) 1982 Sega.
";"Super Zaxxon is a 1- or 2-player video game that presents the player with tremendous challenge and excitement never before experienced. The 3-dimensional-like, isometric graphics are produced by projecting the picture at a slant on the screen, putting the player in remote controlled realism with his player ship.

The player ship climbs, dives and strafes to maneuver through the many obstacles it encounters in its flight. In unique game play action, the player ship appears larger or smaller depending on its altitude, casts trailing shadow that follows it just as a real shadow would. This shadow, an altimeter on the video screen, and the points of impact of the player's gunfire, help judge the altitude of the player's space craft, lending new skill and challenge to Super Zaxxon.

Flying at supersonic speeds, the player confronts an ominous floating munitions fortress.  Here the player ship must battle hidden ground-to-air missiles, rotating gun turrets, tracking parabolic antennas and electrifying maser barriers as he banks, climbs and dives to strafe enemy installations and fuel tanks, gaining valuable points towards ships and extra fuel.

Once through the fortress, Super Zaxxon lures the player ship into a foreboding tunnel where the player must use cautious skill and a responsive extra-heavy duty fighter pilot control stick to overcome the limited ceiling in the tunnel and dodge or destroy a terrific onslaught of flying minelayers, enemy ships and self-destructing robot spaceships, yet also avoid the indestructible mines that crowd the dim corridor.

Accompanied by the roar of space wind, the player soars out of the tunnel to face another battle within the enemy headquarters. This is a more heavily defended floating fortress of tighter passageways armed with maser barriers and increasingly heavier firepower from enemy defenses. Overcoming all this, the player is ready to face the ultimate challenge within the enemy headquarters - a bigger-than-life, fire breathing Dragon who can destroy the player ship with a single breath of fire. With an unnerving wail, the fierce Dragon flies forward and unleashes a breath of flame from its huge mouth. But by firing six direct hits on the Dragon's mouth, the player can defeat the Dragon. The game ends with the loss of the last player ship."
4062;tacscan;tacscan;"Tac/Scan (c) 1982 Sega.
";"Tac/Scan is a 1 or 2-player alternate action game, displayed via Sega's Color X-Y video system. Commanding unprecedented firepower, the player maneuvers seven fighter ships in a squadron formation. All seven ships fire at once when the Fire button is pressed, producing a spectacular missile salvo.

The object of the game is to accumulate points by destroying incoming enemy ships while dodging fireballs launched by these enemies. Tac/Scan presents the space battle from two entirely different perspective views in the course of the game, with visually exciting transition sequences interconnecting the two views.

The player begins the game with a seven-ship formation, and a supply of reserve ships which are shown above the player score on the screen. The number of reserve ships at the beginning of the game is switch selectable. An Add Ship button placed next to the Fire button transfers one of the reserve ships in the squadron formation. Where the reserve ships are placed is shown by a half-intensity fighter in the formation. This 'add ship' position continuously cycles between the empty squadron positions, and the advanced player will time the Add Ship function to place squadron fighters at preferred positions.

A player fighter is blown up by contact with either an enemy ship or an enemy fireball. Whenever all seven ship positions become empty the game is over, even if there are remaining reserve fighters shown above the player score. Thus the player must continuously judge when to add reserve fighters by using the Add Ship button. Add them too early, and they might be depleted too fast; use them too late and you risk ending the game with reserve fighters left over.

There is an additional way to add ships to the squadron. During the course of the action, player fighter ships enter the playfield and intermix with the enemy ships. The player can capture these fighters directly into the seven ship formation by steering them into empty fighter positions. The player's missile fire does not blow up friendly fighters--only enemy ships.

Tac/Scan begins with a top view of the battle. For the first ten seconds the player shoots at enemy ships without having to worry about return fire. After this 'warm-up' period, game play escalates dramatically. During this first phase, a different type of enemy appears just after two of the player fighters fly onto the screen. This is the Stinger, which flits around the field and shoots a deadly laser. This ship is a high priority target, since if not dealt with, it will pick off all of the squadron ships and end the game.

When the player attempts to dock a friendly fighter into the squadron formation, he or she has the choice of any of the empty ship positions shown in the squadron. A special feature occurs when the player ship docks into the front-most ship position (marked with a red 'cursor'). Thin causes the squadron formation to regroup into a different pattern. If the load position is occupied, a fighter is added to the reserve count above the player's score.

At the end of the first phase (the top view) the squadron ships regroup, and a dramatic transition sequence takes the player into phase two. This sequence consists of the fighters rising and enlarging in size, then turning into the screen, lighting afterburners, and proceeding to fly forward to continue the battle. The enemy ships now appear far off in the distance, and grow in size as they approach the player's squadron. The player is given chances to rendezvous with friendly fighters, as in phase one.

At the end of this second phase, a space tunnel appears on the screen, and the player uses the rotary control to steer the squadron formation through the tunnel. Any fighter which hits a side wall of the tunnel explodes on contact. A triangular guide is shown during this sequence to show the player where his triangular ship formation should be. If the player keeps the formation centered within the guide, no ships will be lost.

Once out of the space tunnel, the player resumes with the second round. This is a more difficult top view battle, as at the beginning of the game. Tac/Scan proceeds with multiple two-phase rounds (phase one is the top view, phase two is the rear view) until all squadron ships are lost.

A switch option allows bonus reserve chips to he added with certain score values. The factory set option is to add one reserve ship every 30,000 points.

Regardless of the number of squadron ships on the screen, there are always seven missiles at a time available to the player. If there are seven ships on the screen (a full squadron), pressing the Fire button launches all seven at once. Another push of the Fire button cancels the seven in flight and launches seven new ones. If the squadron is not full, the seven missiles can be independently targeted. For example, with a single ship, seven missiles can be fired in seven directions, and only when the eighth is shot is the first one terminated (if it is still on the screen).

The 2-player game is played with players alternating after successful negotiation of the space tunnel. Whenever a player is eliminated, the other player continues and finishes the game."

";"At its core, Tactician might seem like another Space Invaders / Galaxian clone - you control a small ship at the bottom of the screen, which can actually move up or down a bit, instead of just left and right - but it has a pretty cool gimmick going for it. 

At the beginning of each stage, you can ""draw"" a barrier by placing little dots around the playing field. After several seconds, enemies are released from their bases and begin to swarm the screen. They'll usually make quick work of the barrier, but if you shoot the red ball it'll explode and destroy anything near it. Quite a cool concept for something from 1981 - it's a shame that Tactician is so unknown, and that the idea was never expanded on in any other games. Some versions list the game as copyrighted by Sega, but they apparently only distributed the game in certain territories."

The player will then choose between two control styles: one which fires the gun with one button and drops bombs with the second, while the other style shoots and drops bomb at the same time with a single button (either button can be used).

Like in previous Twin Bee games, there are two kinds of power-ups: bell power-ups obtained from the sky and land power-ups that can be retrieved from destroy ground enemies. The bells can be changed to up to six colors this time (yellow, blue, white, green, red, and pink), each with a unique attribute. GwinBee returns as well as a power-up item, along with the twin attacks that can be performed with GwinBee or another player."

4117;tempest;tempest3;"Tempest (c) 1981 Atari.
";"Tempest is a classic into-the-screen shoot-em-up in which the player controls a claw-shaped ""Blaster"" ship that moves around the outer rim of a three-dimensional, wireframe tunnel. Enemies move down the tunnel towards the player's ship and must be destroyed. Any contact with either incoming enemy fire or the enemies themselves will cost the player a life. Completion of a tunnel will see the player warp through ""hyperspace"" to the next tunnel to tackle a new wave of enemies. 

The tunnels are each rendered in one of sixteen different geometric shapes. Enemies increase in number as the game progresses and if an enemy reaches the outer rim occupied by the player's Blaster ship, it will chase and attempt to kill the player. Rim enemies can be killed, but this is difficult to achieve. 

Some enemies also drag ""spikes"" - in the form of lines in the middle of the corridor - behind them as they travel up the tunnel towards the player. These spikes must be avoided during the ""hyperspace"" warp sequence at the end of the level, as contact results in the loss of a life. 

Two ""SuperZappers"" are available per level. The first SuperZapper kills all enemies on the playfield at the time of firing, while the second randomly kills only one enemy on the playfield. The SuperZapper does not affect enemy shots, spikes or enemies that have not yet landed on the playfield. 

One new feature Tempest introduces is ""Skill-Step"". This allows players to start a new game on the same level as was previously reached (although the new game must be restarted within thirty seconds) without having to replay previous levels. This allows skillful players to continue being challenged, while less experienced players can try to master higher levels. The 99 skill levels of play includes sixteen different playfields and seven different enemy targets. 

* The tubes are divided into cosmic corridors through which the aliens travel, although some aliens such as Pulsars and Flippers can move from one corridor to the next. Regardless of the tube shapes, aliens always begin their invasion from the small, distant end of the tube. The sixteen unique tube shapes are as follows : 

1. Circle 
2. Square 
3. Plus symbol 
4. Bow-tie 
5. Stylized Cross 
6. Triangle 
7. Clover

11. Completely Flat 
12. Heart 
13. Star 
14. W 
15. Fan 
16. Infinity Symbol (figure 8 on its side) 

The playfield's colour scheme changes every sixteen levels. In addition, other events also cause playfield colour variation. The SuperZapper causes the playfield to flash as enemies are zapped. Playfield rails flash rainbow colours when a player earns a bonus life and Pulsar enemies cause sections of the nearest rim to disappear and - during the pulse phase - adjacent rails to flash.

Using the 'Formation' button splits the ship parts into a formation for limited time, giving increased fire power. The number of parts acquired determines the formation.

That other mission is to systematically steal the bricks from your three bases, and use them to spell out the word END up near the top of the screen.

In a final attempt to make this game different from ""Pac-man"", the designer then added dollar signs in each corner of the screen, running over these allows you to chase after your foes, and run over them (not at all like ""Pac-Man""). In later levels these dollar signs may be in places other than the corners (finally, something that actually is different than ""Pac-Man"").

";"The game is a vertical scrolling shooter where the player controls a helicopter taking on hordes of enemies which include tanks, battleships, and artillery. It is interesting to note that, besides some airplanes taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. The player's main weapon is an unlimited supply of missiles which travel a max distance of half the screen's height. The player also has two bombs which destroy all objects within a large circular radius. These bombs can be blown off by enemy bullets. 

The player is killed after only one hit, and is re-spawned to a point approximately one whole vertical screen-length later, thus progressing the player past the obstacle that had killed him, albeit at a high cost. The player is given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 20000 points and every 80000 points thereafter. Flashing crosses scattered throughout each level award players power-ups depending on which color the cross is. A red cross will gives the player one side-firing mini-heli which shoots perpendicular to the player's helicopter. A white cross yields a forward firing mini-heli. It is possible to have a mix and match of side-helis, totaling no more than two. The green cross will award the player with an additional bomb, if the player currently has less than two. Grabbing power-ups when not necessary yields 5000 points.

There are a total of four stages, all of which start and end with a helipad. After completion of the last stage, the game will restart in a more difficult mode starting on stage 2. Most of the game's areas contain unnecessary objects to destroy for bonus points, such as oil drums and houses. This was uncharacteristic for shoot 'em ups at the time."

4181;timber;timber;"Timber (c) 1984 Bally Midway.
";"Timber is an abstract action game in which one or two players assume the role of a lumberjack and have a limited amount of time to chop down a given number of trees that pop up from the ground. The game is controlled with two joysticks, with one stick controlling the player's movement and the other corresponding to left or right chops with the player's axe. Difficulty increases with each level, with the number of trees needed to be chopped down gradually increasing (maxing out at 19) and the allotted time decreasing. 

During a round players must avoid beehives that are thrown at them by grizzly bears. The beehives, however, can be destroyed with the player's axe for a 500-point reward. Some trees contain birds that will run around the level after they have been chopped down, awarding 1,000 points if touched by the player.

Every couple of levels players are given the opportunity to amass bonus points. The bonus round begins with the lumberjack standing on a floating log. As the log begins to rotate, players must use their reflexes to stay on top of the log. The first two times this is played, the log is relatively large; on future attempts, the size of the log shrinks considerably. The bonus round ends if the player falls off the log or balances atop it for the duration of the round, in which case 1,000 bonus points are earned.

The two-player simultaneous mode can be played either competitively or cooperatively. In this mode, chopping or pushing down a tree such that it falls on the opponent awards you with 1,000 points."

As the game's title suggests, time is one of the player's biggest enemies, as each area must be cleared within a strict time limit. Extra time is occasionally awarded, however, when some of the more powerful enemy soldiers are killed.

The game offers the player two different game modes : 
STORY MODE : the player must defeat all of the enemies on the level to proceed to the next level.

STAGE 1 : A.D. 1910 - The Age of Biplane
This stage features an ordinary blue sky with clouds. The attackers are biplanes coming from random directions. Enemy planes shoots at your plane and throw hand grenades when close to you. After 56 biplanes are destroyed, the Mother Ship appears : a giant orange blimp shooting at you! Only seven hits will destroy the Mother Ship. During the same stage, one to five parachutes will appear. Dock with them for bonus points.

STAGE 2 : A.D. 1940 - The Age of Monoplane
Sky is grey-blue with the same clouds.
Enemies are monoplane fighters, middle-size bombers and large bomber (Mother Ship). Middle-size bombers are aiming constantly at your plane! They can be destroyed by four hits and award 1,500 points.

STAGE 3 : A.D. 1970 - The Age of Helicopter
Sky is once again grey-blue, only this time a different shade. The same clouds from the first two stages are also present here.
Enemies now are helicopters and large one (Mother Ship). As a new level of difficulty, the helicopters are using homing missiles.

STAGE 4 : A.D. 1982 - The Age of Jet Plane
The sky is purple with the same clouds as the previous three stages.
The enemies are modern jet fighters shooting and launching homing missiles. A modern large jet bomber is the Mother Ship. This is one of the most difficult stages of the game due to increased speed of jet fighters and random-direction attacks.

STAGE 5 : A.D. 2001 - The Age of UFO.
The sky is pitch black with asteroids instead of clouds.
Hard to be reached and very hard to be passed. Great number of UFO's are attacking from any direction changing their angles of attack and throwing at your plane two types of Alien Weapons. The stage is fast paced and the Mother Ship, a superfortress UFO, can not be so easily destroyed. In addition, there are no enemy formations or parachutes in this stage, and there can be no more than 3 UFO's on the screen at a time.

The next, Stage 6, is identical to Stage 1, but the number of planes attacking you, their speed and number of shots and grenades are gradually increased.

TIME PILOT continues with Stage 7, 8... making your mission harder and harder. The game is all over when all your planes are destroyed."

Releasing the button makes their power balls come back to them; the enemies are killed by having the power balls slam into them.

";"Toobin' is a unique fantasy-adventure game. 1 or 2 players can race Bif and Jet, the Toobin' dudes, in their inner tubes, down 45 different rivers. The players try to keep Jet and Bif afloat, avoiding sharp objects, gaining points, and throwing cans at obstacles. Toobin' appeals to both males and females of all ages who both find it just 'fun to play'.

Toobin' has a continuous buy-in feature so players can join in at any time. Toobin' has a color-coded control panel and players can identify Jet in the yellow inner tube and Bif in the black inner tube and red shorts.

Each player has a set of four buttons to steer Bif or Jet forwards, backwards, and sideways. Pressing the two Paddle Forward buttons moves the inner tube forward. Pressing the two Back Paddle buttons moves the inner tube backwards. Pressing only one Paddle button makes the inner tube turn. The player uses the Throw Can button to destroy obstacles in the river and stun riverside pests.

Toobin' players can enjoy amusing game play and an incredible variety of rivers and environments for their long-term enjoyment.

The player races Bif or Jet against other players, or against the game, down Toobin's 45 different rivers, paddling through six classes of play, and cruising the 15 unique river environments. The player can choose almost 200 courses through the rivers, finding his own way through rapids, obstacles, riverside pests and waterfalls.

The player has to guide Bif or Jet around obstacles, go through gates and pick up treasure to accumulate points to get more inner tube patches, collect cans to throw at obstacles and to stun riverside pests, and paddle fast enough to avoid the big 'gator lurking in all the rivers.

At the finish line, players are treated to a party. Each party grows in size until the player reaches the final super party at the end of the game.

Inner-Tube Patches : At the beginning of each game, the player has a certain number of inner-tube patches, which represent game lives. A player receives extra patches by scoring the number of points required for another patch. The number of points required changes from level to level, and is displayed in the lower left and right corners of the playfield. A player can also receive more patches by picking up patches floating in the rivers.

Cans : The player must accumulate cans to throw at obstacles and pests. All cans are the same value. The player can pick up individual cans floating in all the rivers or six-packs hidden under obstacles or in back waters (Six packs give unlimited cans). The player throws the cans by pointing Bif or Jet at the obstacle and pressing the Throw Can button.

Most of the obstacles in the river can be eliminated by hitting them with a can.

Dangers : The player must avoid or eliminate dangers in the river and stun pests on the river banks. The dangers in the river include falling rocks, floating logs, deadly falling coconuts, icebergs, mines, stampeding cattle, snakes, crocodiles, barbed wire, and thorny bushes.

Dangerous riverside pests throw and shoot objects at Bif and Jet. The player can stun most of these objectionable characters with a can thrown in their direction. These pests include Casting fishermen, Hillbillies, Terrorists, Devils, Martians, Street punks, Pistolaros, Natives, Penguins, Bears, Dinosaurs, and Cavemen.

Big 'Gator : If a player is slow, the big 'gator comes up from behind to discourage slow play and hurry the player through the gates. A loud thumping sound warns the player of its presence. One escape from the big 'gator is to quickly paddle downstream or pass through a gate. If the gator catches Bif or Jet, one inner-tube patch is lost."

Each player has a set of four buttons to steer Bif or Jet forwards, backwards, and sideways. Pressing the two Paddle Forward buttons moves the inner tube forward. Pressing the two Back Paddle buttons moves the inner tube backwards. Pressing only one Paddle button makes the inner tube turn. The player uses the Throw Can button to destroy obstacles in the river and stun riverside pests.

Toobin' players can enjoy amusing game play and an incredible variety of rivers and environments for their long-term enjoyment.

The player races Bif or Jet against other players, or against the game, down Toobin's 45 different rivers, paddling through six classes of play, and cruising the 15 unique river environments. The player can choose almost 200 courses through the rivers, finding his own way through rapids, obstacles, riverside pests and waterfalls.

The player has to guide Bif or Jet around obstacles, go through gates and pick up treasure to accumulate points to get more inner tube patches, collect cans to throw at obstacles and to stun riverside pests, and paddle fast enough to avoid the big 'gator lurking in all the rivers.

At the finish line, players are treated to a party. Each party grows in size until the player reaches the final super party at the end of the game.

Inner-Tube Patches : At the beginning of each game, the player has a certain number of inner-tube patches, which represent game lives. A player receives extra patches by scoring the number of points required for another patch. The number of points required changes from level to level, and is displayed in the lower left and right corners of the playfield. A player can also receive more patches by picking up patches floating in the rivers.

Cans : The player must accumulate cans to throw at obstacles and pests. All cans are the same value. The player can pick up individual cans floating in all the rivers or six-packs hidden under obstacles or in back waters (Six packs give unlimited cans). The player throws the cans by pointing Bif or Jet at the obstacle and pressing the Throw Can button.

Most of the obstacles in the river can be eliminated by hitting them with a can.

Dangers : The player must avoid or eliminate dangers in the river and stun pests on the river banks. The dangers in the river include falling rocks, floating logs, deadly falling coconuts, icebergs, mines, stampeding cattle, snakes, crocodiles, barbed wire, and thorny bushes.

Dangerous riverside pests throw and shoot objects at Bif and Jet. The player can stun most of these objectionable characters with a can thrown in their direction. These pests include Casting fishermen, Hillbillies, Terrorists, Devils, Martians, Street punks, Pistolaros, Natives, Penguins, Bears, Dinosaurs, and Cavemen.

Big 'Gator : If a player is slow, the big 'gator comes up from behind to discourage slow play and hurry the player through the gates. A loud thumping sound warns the player of its presence. One escape from the big 'gator is to quickly paddle downstream or pass through a gate. If the gator catches Bif or Jet, one inner-tube patch is lost."

";"Top Secret is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up set ten years after the end of World War III, with the player taking on the role of 'Super Joe'; an elite Commando tasked with infiltrating the enemy's heavily defended military base to discover their secrets plans and destroy their missile silos. 

To aid him in his mission, Joe is equipped with a bionic arm; a telescopic grappling hook that is used to traverse the many platforms and ledges that make up the game's levels. The arm can also be used to temporarily stun enemies or knock them from platforms, as well as to retrieve the bonus items, wooden crates and weapons that are occasionally dropped into the war zone by parachute. 

As well as the bionic arm, Joe is armed with a shotgun used to kill enemies and destroy obstructions. The shotgun can only be fired left and right, however, and cannot be used at the same time as the bionic arm. More powerful guns can be picked up throughout the game. 

Bionic Commando consists of five stages: 
* Stage 1: Forest 
* Stage 2: Enemy Outpost (The Forefront) 
* Stage 3: Underground Base (Infiltration) 
* Stage 4: Control Tower 
* Stage 5: Stop the Missile 

In the final level, Joe must stop a nuclear missile from launching, before a final confrontation with the game's final boss, the leader of the enemy forces."

";"Turbo Out Run is the first arcade-based sequel to the legendary 1986 original. It eschews the forked-road, variable route gameplay of it's illustrious predecessor and instead opts for a set route point-to-point race across America. There are several new game-play additions, however, which help to differentiate 'Turbo Out Run' from the original.

Firstly, there's the 'Turbo' of the game's title; a turbo boost that greatly increases the car's speed when engaged. It must be used sparingly, however, as overuse will cause the engine to overheat, rendering the turbo useless until such time as the engine has cooled (as indicated by an on-screen 'Overheat' meter).

Weather conditions are another new feature, with both snow and rain having an adverse effect on driving conditions and car handling. Road surfaces also vary greatly in quality, with sand, oil, speed bumps, safety barriers, standing water and other debris all adding to the challenge.

The final new addition is the ability to upgrade the player's car. This is possible upon completion of every four of the game's sixteen stages. Available power-ups are an improved turbo boost, a more powerful engine, or better gripping tires.

Turbo Out-Run's sixteen stages are as follows:

* Stage 1: New York 
* Stage 2: Washington D.C. 
* Stage 3: Pittsburgh 
* Stage 4: Indianapolis (1st car upgrade section) 
* Stage 5: Chicago 
* Stage 6: St. Louis 
* Stage 7: Memphis 
* Stage 8: Atlanta (2nd car upgrade section) 
* Stage 9: Miami

Only two players can compete simultaneously so on 3 and 4-player games, players have to wait their turn.

An extra life is awarded for every 100,000 points acquired.

Each player must qualify in the current event before they can move on to the next.

Hit the two 'Run' buttons to build up speed and use action button to jump or throw. 

The six events are : 
1) 100-meter Dash - Run as fast as possible. 
2) Long Jump - Run to the take-off board then choose angle of jump (42 is optimal). 
3) Javelin Throw - Run to the line then choose angle of throw (42 is optimal). 
4) 110-meter Hurdles - Run and time jumps over the hurdles. 
5) Hammer Throw - As the athlete spins faster and faster, time release of hammer and angle of throw (45 is optimal). 
6) High Jump - The athlete will run to the bar, just as he reaches it, use Action button to start the jump and hold down the action button to reduce the angle of climb, i.e. you start going straight up at 90 degrees if you tap the button just once.

You can find the beans scattered all around the stalk, and picking one up adds one to your ammunition count (or two, depending on the dip switch settings).
* In the second screen, Jack maneuvers through the clouds and attempts to cross the drawbridge into the castle, but lions and birds stand in his way.
* The third screen has Jack climbing the castle stairway in a scene that was obviously inspired by ""Donkey Kong"". Avoid the cat and the mouse and you can make it to the top.
* On the fourth screen you have to jump from platform to platform until you reach the giant's lair. There will be several treasures, grab the flashing one and try to make your escape.
* The fifth screen is the first one again, except that this time you are climbing down the beanstalk, and you have falling rocks to dodge, and the giant himself may even be after you (that one depends on the level).

After making it back to your house you get to watch a little intermission before going after the next treasure. There are four different treasures altogether.

* Blue Trogs who pop up out of the ground and roll stone wheels.
* Green Trogs who bounce around trying to crush you with their springs.

4308;tron;tron2;"Tron (c) 1982 Bally Midway.
";"Tron is a 1- or 2-player game set inside the 'Tron' computer, and is based on the ground-breaking Disney movie of the same name.

Tron consists of twenty-two stages - or 'phases' - of play. Each phase consists of four separate games called ""domains"", all of which must be completed before moving on to the next phase. Players can determine the order in which each of the four domains is attempted, but the domain position is random and is only revealed once that domain has been chosen.

The four domains that make up a phase never change throughout the game, although both the difficulty level and number of enemies increases with each subsequent phase. The domains are as follows:

* LIGHT CYCLES : The player controls a Light Cycle that leaves a blue light trail in its wake. The aim is to 'box in' the yellow enemy Light Cycles, making them crash into either a cycle trail (theirs or the player's) or a wall. The player must also avoid any collision with either walls or light trails. The joystick controls the direction of the bike and the trigger controls its speed.

* I/O TOWER : Destroy the Grid Bugs that emerge from the grid surrounding the tower. The bugs will multiply and fill the entire screen if not stopped. Players must attempt to clear a path to - and enter - the I/O Tower before the timer runs out. The stick controls the movement of the player's character and the spinner controls the direction of fire.

* TANK MAZE : Destroy all enemy tanks that are patrolling the maze. The player's tank can fire in all directions and can bounce shots off walls, but can be destroyed by a single shot; while enemy tanks can only fire in the direction of travel but need three shots before they are destroyed. ""Recognizer"" tanks also feature in later phases; these Do NOT shoot but move quickly and will try to ram the player's tank. The joystick controls the movement of the player's tank and the spinner controls the direction of fire.

* MCP CONE : Destroy the blocks in the descending, rotating coloured column to clear a path and move the character up into the light cone above the blocks. A bonus is awarded if all of the blocks are destroyed. The stick controls the movement of the character and the spinner controls the direction of fire.

Bonus lives are awarded periodically throughout the game as specific point scores are reached. Each enemy and item has an assigned point value (see the ""SCORING"" section for details)."

";"The year is 1989, one year after the great gobble blight which plagued the world. One-third of the earth's populace was transformed by the ailment. The side effect of the turkey transformation is a tendency toward violence and comradery between these turkeys to organize for rabble-rousing in the urban areas. In February of '89, a group of specially trained agents (the turkey terminators) was formed for the sole task of destroying the turkey menace...

And so it begins. As a Turkey Terminator, the player is given 100 missions and 3 weapons to eliminate all the turkeys, leaving no 'left-overs'. He can take aim with his lethal laser gun using the position dot on the screen Screen-shot to hone in on his enemies with deadly accuracy. He can launch a lit grenade to annihilate all the turkeys within range or he can activate his gobble button (available one time each mission) to freeze all the turkeys for an instant, making them 'sitting ducks'. Missions are varied and include reacting quickly to clever ploys such as turkey air raids, turkeys disguising themselves as businessmen and turkey helicopter get-aways. Every 8th round is a rapid-fire bonus wave where the player has 15 seconds to eliminate as many criminals as possible. Shooting fire hydrants and trash cans as well as freeing bystanders who have been taken hostage also score bonus points.

Three 'fowl-ups' are allowed and occur whenever any turkey... a Pilot Turkey, Boss Turkey, Cyborg Turkey or Thug Turkey... escapes or when an innocent bystander... a businessman, shopper or policeman... is damaged."

";"Each level contains exactly 28 buoys. Logs are placed at random and will be re-arranged upon losing a ship on the same level. Of the eight stages, the first four are with a nice, wide river channel. Each of these four stages increases in speed and the number of logs on it. Stages five to eight have a much narrower river and increase in speed on each stage.

Level eight is believed to be unbeatable given the complex arrangement of densely clustered logs on a narrow river. The best strategy is to pass each of the 7 stages first without losing any ships and collecting as many buoys as possible. Then, on stage 8, collect as many buoys as possible until you crash. Once you crash, the stage will re-start and rearrange the logs (giving the player a chance to re-negotiate the tight river).

Ejected enemies act as projectiles that can damage and kill any other on-screen enemies that they collide with. All enemies must be killed before players can progress to the next stage. 

Throughout the game, letters of the alphabet randomly appear in bubbles. These can be collected to eventually spell the word ""TUMBLEPOP"". Once this has been achieved players are transported to a time-limited bonus level, giving them the opportunity to earn bonus points and extra lives. 

If players take too long to finish a stage, a Dracula-like enemy appears. If it touches a player before all enemies have been eliminated, a life is lost. This also applies to the Boss levels.

*Moscow: Set at the Moscow-state circus, enemies are clowns, invisible conjurers and fire spitters. The boss is a giant clown hanging from helium balloons who juggles bombs. 
*Egypt: Set near the pyramids and Sphinx at Giza, enemies include fire spitters and mummies. The boss is a giant genie who spits fireballs.

The only differences in power-ups are that the vehicle slowly loses power even if not damaged, and that instead of a bomb that can be deployed at the player's discretion, the special weapon detonates as soon as its power-up is touched.

Collecting all 4 will send the player to the bonus round. There are bombs that the player also has to avoid to prevent losing a life. The round is ended by collecting the T-U-R-B-O letters.

2) In Turtles you grab each KidTurtle and bring them home. In 600 you must grab up all KidTurtles before the exit appears.
3) In Turtles you must grab bombs from the center when they appear, in 600 you're given a certain amount of energy, which each bomb uses.
4) The wall graphics are a bit more blocky in 600. Also, the cut scenes in between racks in 600 only show one ladder, with the turtle climbing alone."

At the start of each stage, the players select their path of attack through the three areas.  Areas with ground level enemies and targets are presented in a 3/4 isometric view, while areas with no ground targets feature scrolling landscape images.  Players use their guns to attack flying enemy aircraft and bombs to attack ground targets such as tanks, rocket launchers and high-rise skyscrapers.  If things get too hairy, the player can use a missile barrage to clear the screen of enemies and enemy firepower.  Destroying some buildings reveal primary colored trucks which drop weapon power-ups and point items when destroyed.  Each area features a boss at the end, which must be destroyed to advance past the area.  The final stage features one additional boss before the end of the game."

The object of the game, which is not explained further, is to avenge Joe's brother - which is probably not assumed to be the player, but presumably a friend of the player who lost his brother to the enemy. (It uses bad English grammar on the subtitle of the screen, using ""revenge"" as a verb, as apposed to ""avenge"".  That being said, it's a pretty tight game otherwise.)  To do so, you must destroy the fortress on the very last level. When you start the game and it scrolls onto the starting screen, the background contains the different levels that you must survive.

";"Twinkle Star Sprites is a competitive scrolling shooter game originally created by ADK. It was ADK's last production for the Neo-Geo platform. The gameplay, which can be characterized as a combination of a fixed shooter and a versus puzzle game, uses combinations of shots, as well as timed power-ups to attempt to damage the opponent. These attacks also serve as counters to the opponent's attack.

An interesting & highly cute hybrid between a Vs style puzzle game & an overhead shooter, players may choose to play the Story Mode in order to see the misadventures of Load Ran & her faithful yet somewhat annoying Rabbicat as they try to find the Magical Twinkle Star & save their world from the evil Mevious & his henchmen.

";Two Tigers is a 2-D shooter. The game starts by telling you how may hits you must make on the ship before you can claim credit for sinking it. You then will go to the next screen which has your fighter/bomber in the middle of the screen. A gunsight will also be somewhere in the sky (the gunsight is actually the spot where anti-aircraft fire will be hitting at). Soon the sky is filled with enemy planes and a ship enters the screen from the left side. You mission will be to do whatever it takes to put the required number of holes into the enemy ship to sink it. You have at your disposal a single bomb and the enemy planes themselves for achieving your goal. Along the way, other things may assist (if you shoot them) such as mines and fuel drums. The game will go until you fail to sink 2 ships. If you are in 2-player cooperative mode, then the number of holes to sink a ship will be increased.

";"Uo Poko is a puzzle game for one or two players (co-operative). The aim is to clear the screen of coloured glass balls by dropping like-coloured balls down onto them. Connecting three or more like-coloured balls creates a chain reaction and causes them to disappear.

Balls are launched into the play area via a joystick controlled 'pinball-plunger' and as in Pinball, the further the plunger is pulled back, the further the coloured ball will travel. Mastering the strength and distance required is essential in order to drop each ball accurately onto its target. To allow players to learn how to use the plunger, the first two stages feature a guide line which shows exactly where a ball will drop. From the third stage onwards, players must use their judgement alone.

Bonus points are awarded if a stage is completed quickly enough. If too much time is taken, however, the bottom of the stage will start to rise, pushing the balls already in play towards the top of the screen. If the top of the screen is reached, the game is over.

The controls consist of an eight directional joystick and two buttons for jumping and receiving. The characters perform several moves including power spiking, back spiking, jump-serving, blocking and diving.

There are a few minor differences between the Japanese and American releases. The Japanese release features an opening cut-scene explaining the plot. Between matches, intermission sequences depict the main characters visiting a car dealership to purchase a vehicle. As the player progresses, the cars increase in quality, shifting from used cars to new cars during the Major Circuit. The American release removes these cut-scenes, but extends the multiplayer support to up to four players with multiple game modes: 1 or 2 players against the computer, 1-on-1, 2-on-1, or 2-on-2."

";"Evil is lurking in Dead End City. In a turf war, the Dead End Gang has kidnapped Kute Kate from the rivals, the Cobras. The Cobras set out to save her and stop the expansion of the Dead End Gang in Vendetta.

The Dead End Gang is looking to expand their territory, so the Cobras must infiltrate every area around the city. First, they must gain entrance to Dead End City. Relying on their fighting skills, the Cobras face a multitude of enemies. However, each member is up for any challenge from the Dead End Gang. The Cobras are a powerful team consisting of: Blood, an ex-prize fighter; Hawk, a former professional wrestler; Boomer, trained in the martial arts; and Sledge, an ex-military convict. Together they must destroy members of the Dead End Gang to get to the leader, Faust, who knows where Kute Kate is being held.

With fists of fury, the Cobras make their way through various areas of Dead End City. They search the construction site for Kate, battling the humanoid weapon The Missing Link to gain information. From there, they are sent on futile chases through other sections of the city, including downtown, the waterfront, and the slums, where the final confrontation with Faust takes place. Throughout the game, the Cobras can pick up special weapons and food for more energy. Each player also has his own 'special attack' method to help defeat the toughest enemies.

Once Kute Kate is rescued and Dead End City is liberated, the Cobras victoriously start back to their home turf. However, much to their surprise, the entrance to their town is blocked by Dead End Gang bosses. The Cobras must gear up once more for the ultimate showdown to restore peace to Dead End City."

Each dungeon is represented as a floor plan, populated with a number of ""Space Invader"" like monsters. Numerous rooms and their corresponding doors are clearly marked; these rooms are the treasure rooms and each one must be cleared. When the player enters a room, the viewpoint zooms in on the action and the room takes up the whole screen. Each room has a treasure or weapon guarded by one or more creatures. Players must try to retrieve the treasure while avoiding (or killing) creatures and obstacles. Only in the rooms themselves can players use their bow and arrow.

When the treasure is successfully taken out of the chamber, bonus points are awarded. The screen image then returns to the original, zoomed-out floor plan and the player moves on to the next room of their choice.

Released in October 1986 in USA and EUROPE. In this Export release, the voices were changed to speak English dialogue. For example, upon starting the game the player would be greeted by a giant floating head who would exclaim, ""Warriors! Show some guts! You can't escape me! Come get me if you can! Ha ha ha ha haa!"" At this point the floating head would fly off screen and the gameplay commenced. After the player loses a life, one would hear ""Come on, let's fight!"" upon returning to the game.

4521;warlords;warlords;"Warlords (c) 1980 Atari.
";"Atari's Warlords depicts a third-person view of four castles. The player-controlled Warlords and computer-controlled Black Knights use shields to defend their castle walls from the fireballs that ricochet around the playfield. 

Players can capture and catapult the fireballs at opposing castles, using their shield control and 'Power Stone' pushbutton. When a fireball hits a castle wall, it destroys one or more bricks, depending on its speed. 

A castle not paid for is controlled by the computer, with a Black Knight displayed in the appropriate castle. The Black Knights catapult fireballs at the players with increasing accuracy, to provide challenge. 

Game play begins when any start button is pressed and the countdown has ended. The game ends when the last Warlord's castle (containing a crown) has been penetrated by a fireball. At this point a white cloud envelopes the crown, and the latter disappears. 

During the countdown, a dragon flies back and forth across the screen with a fireball in its mouth. At the end of the countdown, a position activated by a start button has its Black Knight changed to a Warlord's crown. A position not activated remains as a Black Knight and is controlled by the computer. The dragon then spits the fireball from its mouth toward a Warlord's castle. 

The objective is to destroy the three other castles, while protecting one's own castle with the moving shield. The LED pushbuttons have dual functions: in the ready-to-play mode they work as start switches, and during game play they become 'Power Stones' to allow players to capture and catapult fireballs at opponents. 

The spinning fireballs released from a shield have more destructive force on a castle wall than a fireball simply deflected from another wall or the sides of the playfield. However, players will soon find out that they cannot hold onto a fireball for long, since it slowly destroys their own castle walls adjacent to the fireball. 

Additional fireballs appear at predetermined intervals or when a castle is destroyed, whichever comes first. A maximum of four fireballs simultaneously appear on the screen. 

In 1- and 2-player games, the Warlords' crowns will be accompanied by a zero, to begin scoring. The point-scoring system is printed on each control panel (the Black Knights do not earn points). 

If a Black Knight has the surviving castle, the game ends. However, if a Warlord has the surviving castle, that player receives bonus points, all castles are rebuilt, and the game continues with a new battle at a higher level. In a 2-player game, both players continue in the game, but only one player can get bonus points. If both Black Knights are eliminated first and only Warlords remain, the level becomes a free-for-all between the two Warlords until one is eliminated. The other Warlord then gets the bonus points, and the game begins again. 

The subsequent levels begin, as mentioned before, with the fireball thrown out by the dragon. In the higher levels, Black Knights play more accurately and faster. 

3- and 4-player games (available in the cocktail version only) are free-for-alls. No scores are kept, and the game ends as soon as there is only one castle left."

";"The objective of the game is to pursue the mystery aliens by warping across 2 different worlds : the Space World and Maze World.  The player may choose when to warp to a different world, so it is possible to continue playing in the same world throughout the game. In Space World, the character uses a gun to shoot up enemy aliens, and in Maze World, aliens are killed using a time-delay bomb. The delay is controlled by the length of time the button is held down, and the player loses if the character is caught in the resulting explosion.

Power-ups may appear on some levels, and allow the player to shoot exploding bullets or attach bombs directly onto enemy aliens. However, the exploding bullets usable in Space World can only obtained in Maze World, and the power-up to attach bombs onto enemies in Maze World only appears in Space World.

Unlike previous Rastan games that featured only Rastan himself, players can now choose to play as one of three different warriors: Rastan, Dewey (a hireling) or Sophia (a thief).

Players must then fight their way through a multitude of enemy-packed levels set in a variety of different locations, such as castles, a forest, a swamp and on board a sinking ship. Certain levels also have the players riding on animals, such as horses and dragons. Coins and treasure items can be found in the numerous barrels and chests that litter the levels, as well as being dropped by some defeated enemies. Bonus points and ""vitality"" - depending on the amount of treasure collected - are awarded upon the level's completion.

As well as coins and treasure, other bonus items can be found that give weapon and magical-weapon power-ups, as well as extra vitality (health).

Level progression through the game is not linear. After the very first level, ""Depon Road"", players are presented with a map of the Kingdom, and can choose which of four different routes they wish to take next. The available routes are; Castle (Northwest), Tower (Northeast), Ship (Southwest) and Palace (Southeast)."
4528;waterski;waterski;"Water Ski (c) 1983 Taito Corp.
";"In this timed abstract racing game, a single player controls a water-skier who is being pulled along behind a power-boat. The objective is to complete the course in as fast a time as possible to reach the next course, while avoiding rocks, sharks, motor boats, wind surfers and numerous other obstacles.

The player can move their skier left or right, and can press buttons to either slow the boat's speed or to jump over obstacles. Small rocks are the most common obstacle and can either be avoided or jumped over. As well as the small rocks that litter each course, there are also occasional large rocks; these cannot be jumped and must be avoided at all costs. Also, players must be watchful of the direction their tow-boat takes them otherwise they risk being dragged into oncoming obstacles or having their tow-rope snapped on one of the large rocks.

As well as obstacles, each stage also contains one or more large jump ramps. To make a successful jump, players must ensure they hit the bottom of the ramp with their ski-board facing directly forwards. At the top of the ramp players must press the JUMP button, which will propel them from the end of the ramp to make a perfect landing in the water below. Making a successful ramp jump awards the player with bonus points, but if a player fails to hit the bottom of the ramp properly, they will crash and lose valuable seconds."

The player's character is an armor wearing beastmaster who sits atop of a fist-fighting giant.  Upon the player's command, the player may switch his mount into a tiger and attack with his mace.  Within each stage, there are also power-ups that allow the player to morph into a laser breathing dragon for a limited period of time.

The player's life bar is represented by a fire breathing dragon in the upper corner.  With each hit the player takes, the fire breath grows smaller.  Once the life bar is depleted the player's mount is killed and the player travels on foot and fights with throwing daggers.  If hit in this form then the player loses a life.  The game is over when all of a players lives are lost."

Each martian takes several hits to destroy, as you are actually blasting their legs out from under them. You can protect yourself from their shots by using your shield button, but use it sparingly, as you only have a limited amount of shield time.
4604;wow;wow;"Wizard of Wor (c) 1980 Midway.
";"Welcome to WIZARD OF WOR! In this magical game, you are a worrior descending into deep dungeon mazes, battling invisible monsters, cacodemons, and maybe even the Wizard of Wor himself! Be of good cheer, worrior, for herein lie many of the secrets of the Wizard. 

Wizard of Wor is a game for 1 or 2 players. When the 2-player mode is selected, both players control their worriors at the same time. Teamwork in the 2-player mode is very important (but not necessary to play). 

The object of Wizard of Wor is to descend as far into the dungeons of Wor as possible, killing monsters, beating the Wizard, and earning as high a score as you can. The game ends when all the players' worriors have been destroyed. 

At the start of the game, you are placed in dungeon one. It contains six blue Burwors. Using the joystick and fire button, maneuver your worrior around the maze and shoot them. As you shoot the last Burwor, a yellow Garwor will come out. Garwors and red Thorwors will turn invisible. The radar will show the positions of the invisible monsters. Invisible Garwors and Thorwors will become visible when they enter the same corridor that a worrior is in. As time goes by, the monsters speed up. The longer it takes before you shoot them, the faster they go. When you have destroyed the Thorwor, the first dungeon ends. 

In the 2nd dungeon, a different maze is randomly selected. Once again, six Burwors are placed here. More Garwors and Thorwors will appear this time, however. When the last Thorwor has been shot, Worluk will come out and try to escape out one of the side doors. If you shoot him before he escapes, all point values will be doubled in the next dungeon. After Worluk has been shot or has escaped, the Wizard of Wor may then appear. He teleports closer and closer, continuously firing lightning bolts. He continues to do so until either one worrior has been destroyed, or the Wizard has been shot. 

After dungeon 3 or 4, a bonus player is awarded (option switch selectable). You must then face the Arena. This is the toughest of the lower level dungeons. The Worlord dungeons begin at dungeon eight. They are very difficult to survive. At dungeon thirteen, another bonus player is awarded, and you must try to win your way through The Pit. The ultimate goal of Wizard of Wor is to survive The Pit without losing any worriors. 

In a 1-player game, the other worrior (blue) is your friend. He will not shoot you unless you come between him and a monster, then he will try to shoot the monster, and you could be hit by his shot. 
In a 2-player game, both players play at the same time. They do not take turns. The two players may elect to shoot each other. But, if you wish to survive for long, you must use teamwork! 

And now worrior, go forth and do battle with the Wizard of Wor!"

";"The player pilots a combat aircraft called a 'Solvalou' which is armed with a forward-firing gun for aerial targets, and bombs for destroying ground-based targets. A red targeting square is situated in front of the Solvalou, which allows the player to aim their bombs accurately. The enemy craft appears in a number of different guises; from the standard variety that arrive in large numbers but shoot slow-moving projectiles, to exploding black spheres that shoot projectiles at high speed. There are also rotating shields that cannot be destroyed and must be carefully avoided. Ground enemies are a combination of both stationary bases and moving vehicles, most of which fire slow-moving projectiles. A gigantic, floating fortress (called 'Andor Genesis') appears in certain areas; this is defeated by knocking out its core. 

Xevious is actually divided into 16 different areas, which are separated by an area of forest. If a player dies before less than 70% of an area has been completed, play restarts at the beginning of the same area; should a life be lost AFTER 70% of an area has been completed, however, play restarts at the beginning of the next area. After Area 16 has been completed, the game loops back to Area 7.

";"X-Men is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for up to four players. The X-Men's mission is to find and rescue Professor X, who has been captured by evil mutants and is now being held prisoner by Magneto.

Each X-Man character has an 'Attack', 'Jump' and 'Mutant Power' button. The mutant power attack is a powerful special move unique to each X-Man. While it inflicts a lot of damage on the enemies, the trade-off is that each usage removes 3 bars from the players health meter (a full meter has 10 bars). Each level ends with a face-off against a powerful mutant boss character.

The game has six stages, with the final one set on 'Asteroid M', Magneto's base. The defeated mutant bosses from the previous levels each make an appearance (albeit in a less powerful form) before the final encounter with Magneto himself.

Players can chose from 6 X-Men characters, they are:
Cyclops 
Colossus 
Wolverine 
Storm 
Nightcrawler 
Dazzler"

";"The game centers around an unusual alien invasion against a colony planet in the year 2249—the aliens themselves are microscopic creatures that invade, infect, and kill the colonists. Scientists have deployed the microscopic fighter X-002 into the body of the hapless woman whose body has been invaded by the alien queen.

The game itself is a side-scroller like R-Type, albeit with a short vertical-scrolling area towards the end of the sixth level. Instead of the Force pod, however, the main power-up apparatus takes the form of two flexible tentacles. The tentacles are invulnerable to all enemy attacks, and can be positioned with careful maneuvering of the X-002."

";"Xybots is a 3-Dimensional, 3rd-person perspective shoot-em-up for 1 or 2 players. Taking on the role of either 'Major Rock Hardy' or 'Captain Ace Gunn' (in the 2-player game), players must shoot their way through a huge, multi-level underground city - made up of a series of mazes - and destroy the evil 'Xybot' robot warriors that have invaded the planet and established their underground fortress. The players' on-screen counterparts walk 'into' the screen and players must manually rotate the maze's viewpoint left and right when changing direction in order to be able to look in the direction they are moving. 

Each level has at least one exit that must be reached in order to progress to the next (some levels have extra hidden exits that 'warp' players to later levels). Players can find energy pods to restore energy levels, keys to open doors, and golden coins. Some of the levels also feature transporters that connect different parts of the same level.

At the end of each level, players can enter a shop where supplies and power-ups can be purchased with any coins they have collected. Some supplies, such as 'Shield' or 'Speed' are permanent, whereas others are only temporary and must be replenished.

A map of each level is displayed at the top of the screen. For some levels, all enemies, objects and walls are shown. On later levels, however, the map may only display the enemy robots and/or objects; with the maze walls and layout only becoming visible once a player has 'looked' at a wall section. Xybots' gameplay feels highly reminiscent of a 3-Dimensional ""Gauntlet"" (with good reason, see TRIVIA for more details). The game also uses a split-screen display to allow for two-player simultaneous play; something of an innovation for 1987.

Like the ""Gauntlet"" games on which Xybots is based; the game is endless and play will continue until all lives are lost and players no longer wish to use the 'Continue' option."

That's the rush the player gets with 10-YARD FIGHT, the 1- or 2-player video with the continuous play feature. The thrill of controlling the action. Of calling the plays and carrying the ball. Of a real Pro contest of America's # 1 Game.

The player takes the field, takes the ball and takes on as much action as he can handle. He must score a touchdown in the time allotted to go from high school and college all the way to the Pros and the Super Bowl, with cheerleaders marking his progress-in-between.

Each level begins with the player carrying the ball on the kick-off as far up the field as he can before getting tackled. Then he's in control as quarterback, running with the ball or going for a forwards pass or a lateral to a receiver who let's him know he's open by waving his arms. If the pass is intercepted a 20 yard penalty is called. As in authentic Pro ball, the clock is stopped when the player runs out of bounds. For bonus points after the referee signals a touchdown, the player can kick the ball or run with it to score ""points after"".

";"Yie Ar Kung Fu is a classic one-on-one fighting game that pits a single player against a procession of distinctive, and often armed opponents. While somewhat limited in gameplay terms, Yie Ar Kung-Fu introduced a major innovation to the beat-em-up genre as it was the first one-on-one fighter to offer a progression of truly different opponents for the player to defeat. This is something that would later be adopted by Capcom for its legendary Street Fighter series; as well as SNK and countless others. Many of Yie Ar's eleven opponents are armed with a wide variety of weapons, such as a nunchuks, throwing stars, a chain, a sword and a club.

Yie Ar Kung-Fu is a game of reflexes and as such plays incredibly quickly, with the player having to be constantly on the move to avoid getting 'pegged in' by some of the game's tougher opponents. The first five fights take place in front of an animated waterfall, while the remaining six have the player battling in front of a picturesque, oriental pagoda. There is no time limit set in which the opponent must be defeated and the player's character, Oolong, possesses a finite amount of health per stage. Should the player's health bar be fully depleted, the match is lost."

If the ship's fuel runs out, it crashes to the ground and a life is lost.

* Fighter Fleet: This takes place in outer-space with the player attacked by waves of enemy fighters and rogue satellites. The player ship's fuel does not deplete during this wave.

* Enemy Headquarters: This is similar to the 'Floating Fortress' wave (with fuel depletion once again being an issue), but with the player facing much tougher defences.

Fighters and Robo-probes are often shielded (in red), and each consecutive hit reduces the enemies shield strength, until, when the shield drops, a hit will destroy it. In addition, you will encounter three types of Moboids :

* Blue Moboids bounce all ships.
* Red Moboids destroy all un-shielded ships (including the players ship).

After defeating three attack waves, the Alien Robot holding that city will reappear within rotating protective rings, through which a 'slot shot' neutralizes that Robot, awarding the player a bonus ship and advancement to the next round."

The color of 'Mitiohro' on the picture changes when the gates for takeoff and landing of 'Ahro' opens. It is the time to attack!

As you destroy 'Ahro', 'Mitiohro' becomes to leave the 'Goke's' body, but you cannot destroy those 'Mitiohro' with your laser beam.

You can get a higher score depending of the precision landing of your spaceship at nearer spot to the center of the 'Battlestar-asat' base.

When you score 20,000 points, you can get one more Zogram and at 50,000 points you can get another Zogram."

";"Zoo Keeper is a superb, fast-paced arcade game in which the player takes control of Zeke the zookeeper. Many of the animals at Zeke's zoo are running wild and have captured Zeke's girlfriend, Zelda. Zeke must recapture as many animals as possible and rescue his sweetheart from the animals' clutches.

Zoo Keeper features two different, alternating play fields, with each level having its own task to complete; as well as a final 'bonus screen'. The three levels are as follows :

On the first play field, players must move Zeke around the outside of an animal enclosure, constantly re-building the enclosure wall that the animals are set on destroying. Any wild animals that are loose must be jumped over or the player will lose a life. The level's timer is represented as a fizzing fuse, and along this fuse are a number of bonus items such as beer or a net for catching escaped animals. When the timer's fuse reaches an item, it will appear on screen and can be picked up. Once the timer makes it to the word 'End', the current level is completed and play moves on to the next level. The bonus items that occasionally appear include mugs of beer, ice cream sundaes, clover clubs, watermelons, etc.

If Zeke manages to pick up a net, he will be able to capture the animals and put them back into the Zoo. The net will eventually disappear and the captured animals will try to escape once more by breaking through the enclosure wall. Zeke will have to continue building the wall around the Zoo until the time is up. At the end of the level, bonus points are awarded for every animal inside the wall. Animals found on this level are snakes, moose, camels, rhinos, elephants, and a lion.

On the second, more difficult play field, Zelda is tied to a palm tree and Zeke must rescue her by jumping to the top of the screen via a series of moving platforms; dodging the coconuts thrown by a mischievous monkey. On each of the platforms, various foods and drinks can collected to earn extra points. Sometimes, one of the ledges will have a 'Free Game' sign that will grant the player a free credit. While Zelda is tied up, she says 'save me', and whenever Zeke gets knocked out by one of the deadly coconuts, she says 'Oh, no!' If Zeke makes it all the way to the top and rescues her, she says 'My Hero' and a bonus of 5,000 points is awarded.

The first and second screens are alternated before the player finally reaches the third and final 'bonus screen'. Here, Zeke must jump over the herds of charging animals that are running from a cage at the foot of an escalator. Zeke must reach the escalator behind the animals' cage and make his way up to the next floor, where a second escalator - replete with more charging animals - awaits. Zeke must reach the top of the second escalator to rescue the trapped Zelda.

After Zeke has rescued Zelda on the final screen, the game begins again with an increased level of difficulty."

";Zwackery was a sword-fighting and spell-casting game in which the player controls a cartoony wizard Zak Thwacker on a quest to restore an enchanted frog back into the buxom princess she once was. A platform-style exploration game, the world that Zak explores is actually dozens of different screens which the player exits and enters through doorways and tunnels in search of spell and other powerups that will help him defeat the Evil Ghoulum. The Sword can be used to stab, or it can be spun around the player. The Shield, which can be wielded in the same manner, provides protection. Spells include Bouncing Boots, Shooting Swords, Invisibility Potions, Magic flutes, and a Dragons Egg, which put Leapin Fungoes to sleep and allows safe passage through the Dragon's Lair.

ZZYZZYXX's vulnerability increases (as he collects gifts, as well as points) not only because of Lola's untouchable attitude, but because of obstacles such as rattifers trying to put an end to ZZYZZYXX's quest for Lola's love and affection.

Intelligent as the rattifers may be, there are 2 defenses ZZYZZYXX can use to outsmart the destructive creatures. ZZYZZYXX can brick himself within a brick when he sees an approaching rattifer or ZZYZZYXX can move into the space where there is a gold helmet. The gold helmet intensifies ZZYZZYXX's goal to reach Lola by allowing ZZYZZYXX to use the helmet to enclose a rattifer or break through one brick which is obstructing ZZYZZYXX's course towards Lola.

As irreproachable as Lola appears. Lola is overjoyed by ZZYZZYXX's success to retrieve enough presents and she whistles resoundingly to let ZZYZZYXX know. After ZZYZZYXX's triumphant deed for love. ZZYZZYXX becomes invincible, enabling him to elude the rattifers by imprisoning them within their spaces.

Other dangers testing ZZYZZYXX's skillful maneuvering are falling bombs, rising missiles and cracked bricks, each capable of disintegrating ZZYZZYXX.

As an added attraction, when a game player completes each level, there are animated cartoons depicting ZZYZZYXX's passionate desire to impress his love for Lola. Also delightful music throughout the game leaves the players humming and their foot tapping."
